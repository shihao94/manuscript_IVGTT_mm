abstract = {Obesity is characterized by variable degrees of hyperinsulinaemia, which has been attributed to either $\beta$-cell hypersecretion or reduced hepatic insulin extraction, or both. To investigate this controversial issue, a 4-h frequently sampled i.v. glucose tolerance test (glucose dose 12.8 g m-2) was performed in 13 normotolerant, grossly obese adolescents (10 F/3 M; 13 ± 1 y; body mass index 32 ± 0.9; pubertal stage 4-5; obesity duration 7.8 ± 3 y) and in a comparable group of 8 healthy, normal-weight subjects. Glucose, insulin and C-peptide time-course were analysed by the minimal model technique, which estimates $\beta$-cell secretion, insulin sensitivity (S(i)), glucose effectiveness (S(G)) and hepatic insulin extraction (HE). Despite similar fasting and after load glucose patterns (S(G) similar in the two groups), obese adolescents showed sustained peripheral hyperinsulinaemia (total insulin area under the concentration curve 67.2 ± 10.8 vs 19.1 ± 1.2 pmol l-1 in 240 min; p {\textless} 0.002) and a 71{\%} reduction in S(i) (2.02 ± 0.33 vs 6.95 ± 1.03 x 104 min-1 ($\mu$U ml-1); p {\textless} 0.001). Compared with control subjects, the total amounts of prehepatic insulin secretion and posthepatic insulin delivery were also increased significantly in obese adolescents by 30{\%} and 46{\%}, respectively; HE was reduced by 15{\%} during the first 30 min of the test, but recovered within the normal range during the rest of the test. In conclusion severely obese adolescents are insulin resistant and their hyperinsulinaemia is primarily caused by $\beta$-cell hypersecretion, whereas the reduction in insulin hepatic extraction is a transient metabolic phenomenon.},

abstract = {Glucose utilization of different organs (spleen, liver, ileum, kidney, skin, lung, and testis) was investigated in vivo in conscious rats 3, 24, or 48 h after treatment with 100 micrograms of endotoxin/100 g of body weight. Glucose uptake was determined by the 2-deoxyglucose technique, which was validated by demonstrating that endotoxin treatment did not alter either the intracellular retention of the phosphorylated metabolites (P-2-dGlc) of the tracer or the discrimination against 2-deoxyglucose in pathways of glucose metabolism. At 3 h after endotoxin the accumulation of P-2-dGlc was markedly increased in the liver (4.8-fold), spleen and skin (2.9-fold), lung (2.4-fold), and ileum and kidney (2.1-fold), as compared to time-matched controls. This effect was sustained in the liver at 24 and 48 h, was diminishing but still significant in spleen, ileum, and kidney, and absent in skin and lung. Accumulation of P-2-dGlc in the testis remained unchanged after endotoxin. Glucose uptake by individual organs and their contribution to whole body glucose utilization in control and endotoxin-treated rats were compared based on P-2-dGlc accumulation data. Organs rich in mononuclear phagocytes (liver and spleen) exhibited a marked and prolonged increase in glucose uptake after endotoxin. Yet the bulk of the increment in the whole body glucose disappearance rate (Rd) was due to three large tissues (skin, intestine, and muscle, accounting for more than 80{\%} of the total P-2-dGlc accumulation in soft tissues), which showed a more moderate and transient increase in glucose utilization.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance is associated with a low chronic inflammatory state. In this study we investigated the relationship between impaired insulin sensitivity and selected markers of inflammation and thrombin generation in obese healthy women. We examined 32 healthy obese women (body mass index ≥ 28), with normal insulin sensitivity (NIS, n = 14) or impaired insulin sensitivity (n = 18), and 10 nonobese women (body mass index {\textless} 25). Impaired insulin sensitivity patients had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), TGF-$\beta$1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), activated factor VII (VIIa), and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) compared with either control subjects or NIS patients. On the other hand, NIS patients had higher CRP, TGF-$\beta$1, PAI-1, and factor VIIa, but not F1 + 2, levels than controls. Significant inverse correlations were observed between the insulin sensitivity index and TGF-$\beta$1, CRP, PAI-1, factor VIIa, and F1 + 2 levels. Moreover, significant direct correlations were noted between TGF-$\beta$1 and CRP, PAI-1, factor VIIa, and F1 + 2 concentrations. Finally, multiple regressions revealed that TGF-$\beta$1 and the insulin sensitivity index were independently related to F1 + 2. Our results are the first to document an in vivo relationship between insulin sensitivity and coagulative activation in obesity. The elevated TGF-$\beta$1 levels detected in the obese population may provide a biochemical link between insulin resistance and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that insulin resistance, per se, contributes to increased platelet activation in obesity, independently of underlying inflammation. Background: Obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis are closely linked phenomena associated with low-grade inflammation. Obesity is associated with persistent platelet activation in otherwise healthy women. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study in 40 obese and 20 non-obese healthy women using urinary thromboxane metabolite excretion as a non-invasive index of platelet activation. An index of insulin sensitivity, SI, and plasma adiponectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and CD40 ligand (CD40L) levels were measured. Results: Obese women had significantly (p {\textless} 0.0001) higher 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (11-dehydro-TXB2) excretion (median 718 vs. 211 pg/mg creatinine), CRP (1.13 vs. 0.48 mg/l), and CD40L levels (4.45 vs. 0.90 ng/ml) than controls. Obese women had lower SI (median 2.51 vs. 5.0 104 min-1/[$\mu$U/ml], p {\textless} 0.002) and adiponectin (6.3 vs. 10 $\mu$g/ml, p {\textless} 0.01) than control subjects. On multiple regression analysis, waist-to-hip ratio ($\beta$ = 0.27, p {\textless} 0.05) and SI ($\beta$ = -0.72, p {\textless} 0.04) predicted 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion rate, independently of adiponectin, CRP, CD40L, and lipid patterns. In order to investigate the cause-effect relationship of these associations, we examined the effects of a 12-week weight loss program or a 3-week pioglitazone treatment on urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 in 10 women with impaired SI and visceral obesity. Successful weight loss (0.6 kg loss/week) achieved in 5 subjects was associated with increased SI (+92{\%}) and decreased CD40L (-27{\%}), CRP (-37{\%}), and 11-dehydro-TXB2 (-53{\%}) (p {\textless} 0.05). Consistently, improvement of insulin sensitivity achieved with pioglitazone significantly decreased urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion (-43{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05) without changes in body weight. Conclusions: Insulin resistance is a major determinant of platelet activation in female obesity. {\textcopyright} 2006 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Purpose: For some biological systems, there exist several models with somewhat different features and perspectives. We propose an evaluation method for NLME models by analyzing real and simulated data from the model of main interest using a structurally different, but similar, NLME model. We showcase this method using the Integrated Glucose Insulin (IGI) model and the Integrated Minimal Model (IMM). Additionally, we try to map parameters carrying similar information between the two models. Methods: A bootstrap of real data and simulated datasets from both the IMM and IGI models were analyzed with the two models. Important parameters of the IMM were mapped to IGI parameters using a large IMM simulated dataset analyzed under the IGI model. Results: Comparison of the parameters estimated from real data and data simulated with the IMM and analyzed with the IGI model demonstrated differences between real and IMM-simulated data. Comparison of the parameters estimated from real data and data simulated with the IGI model and analyzed with the IMM also demonstrated differences but to a lower extent. The strongest parameter correlations were found for: insulin-dependent glucose clearance (IGI) {\~{}} insulin sensitivity (IMM); insulin-independent glucose clearance (IGI) {\~{}} glucose effectiveness (IMM); and insulin effect parameter (IGI) {\~{}} insulin action (IMM). Conclusions: We demonstrated a new approach to investigate models' ability to simulate real-life-like data, and the information captured in each model in comparison to real data, and the IMM clinically used parameters were successfully mapped to their corresponding IGI parameters.},

abstract = {Population approaches are more robust estimators of insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness (SG) with the minimal model of glucose kinetics during an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). We assessed the performance of 3 population methods, iterative two-stage (ITS), Bayesian hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and NONMEM first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) with interaction (NM), and made a comparison with the standard two-stage method (STS) employing the weighted nonlinear regression analysis. To evaluate accuracy of individual and population estimates, 40 simulated insulin-modified frequently sampled IVGTTs (IM-FSIVGTT) were derived from real IM-FSIVGTTs (0.3 g glucose per kg body weight with 0.02 U/kg insulin at 20 minutes; 30 samples over 180 minutes) performed in 40 healthy Caucasian subjects (male/female, 22/18; age, 46 ± 9 years; body mass index [BMI], 26.7 ± 5.7 kg{\textperiodcentered}m-2; mean ± SD). The population methods assumed a log-normal population distribution of parameters. All methods gave a similar but overestimated population SG by 9{\%} to 13{\%}. Population SI was underestimated to a different degree by the methods (STS 6{\%}, ITS 10{\%}, MCMC 13{\%}, and NM 7{\%}). The between-subject variability of SG was overestimated by STS and underestimated by the population methods (true 33{\%}, STS 40{\%}, ITS 19{\%}, MCMC 24{\%}, NM 24{\%}; coefficient of variation). For SI, this quantity was well estimated by all methods (true 79{\%}, STS 80{\%}, ITS 82{\%}, MCMC 83{\%}, NM 82{\%}). The results for individual estimates indicate that STS performs better than the population methods when estimating SI (STS 12{\%}, ITS 16{\%}, MCMC 16{\%}, NM 16{\%}; 1 outlying subject excluded; root mean squared error expressed as percent of mean) but worse for SG (STS 28{\%}, ITS 21{\%}, MCMC 20{\%}, NM 19{\%}). We conclude that the robust performance of population approaches, preventing parameter estimation failures associated with the nonlinear regression analysis, is not required with IM-FSIVGTT in subjects with normal glucose tolerance. The standard two-stage technique is the preferred method under such circumstances. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We adopted Bayesian analysis in combination with hierarchical (population) modelling to estimate simultaneously population and individual insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness (SG) with the minimal model of glucose kinetics using data collected during insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and made comparison with the standard non-linear regression analysis. After fasting overnight, subjects with newly presenting Type II diabetes according to World Health Organization criteria (n = 65; 53 males, 12 females; age, 54 ± 9 years; body mass index, 30.4 ± 5.2 kg/m2; means ± S.D.) underwent IVGTT consisting of a 0.3 g of glucose bolus/kg of body weight given at time zero for 2 min, followed by 0.05 unit of insulin/kg of body weight at 20 min. Bayesian inference was carried out using vague prior distributions and log-normal distributions to guarantee non-negativity and, thus, physiological plausibility of model parameters and associated credible intervals. Bayesian analysis gave estimates of SI in all subjects. Non-linear regression analysis failed in four cases, where Bayesian analysis-derived SI was located in the lower quartile and was estimated with lower precision. The population means of SI and SG provided by Bayesian analysis and non-linear regression were identical, but the interquartile range given by Bayesian analysis was tighter by approx. 20{\%} for SI and by approx. 15{\%} for SG. Individual insulin sensitivities estimated by the two methods were highly correlated (rS = 0.98; P {\textless} 0.001). However, the correlation in the lower 20{\%} centile of the insulin-sensitivity range was significantly lower than the correlation in the upper 80{\%} centile (r S = 0.71 compared with rS = 0.99; P {\textless} 0.001). We conclude that the Bayesian hierarchical analysis is an appealing method to estimate SI and SG, as it avoids parameter estimation failures, and should be considered when investigating insulin-resistant subjects.},

abstract = {Obesity is characterized by peripheral hyperinsulinemia, for which either $\beta$-cell hypersecretion, diminished hepatic insulin extraction, or both may be responsible. To clarify this issue, we investigated insulin secretion and hormone hepatic extraction in 18 nondiabetic obese patients (body mass index [BMI], 39 ± 1.3 kg/m2) and 18 healthy, lean control subjects (BMI, 21.3 ± 0.7 kg/m2). Body fat distribution was calculated by measuring the waist to hip ratio (WHR). A highly reduced tissue insulin sensitivity (2.4 ± 0.5 v 9.5 ± 1.5 104 {\textperiodcentered} min-1/[$\mu$U/mL], P {\textgreater} .0005) and glucose effectiveness, ie, glucose's ability to stimulate its own disappearance at basal insulin (16 ± 2 v 30 ± 3 103 {\textperiodcentered} min-1, P {\textgreater} .005), were found in the overweight subjects compared with the controls. The basal (76 ± 14 v 37 ± 4 pmol/L/min) and total (377,848 ± 5,562 v 16,864 ± 1,850 pmol/L) prehepatic insulin secretion and the basal (15 ± 2 v 7 ± 0.7 pmol/L/min) and total (8,286 ± 2,009 v 2,840 ± 210 pmol/L) posthepatic insulin delivery were significantly higher in the overweight subjects compared with the controls (P {\textless} .005), whereas the mean hepatic insulin extraction did not differ (77.8{\%} ± 2.6{\%} v 79.5{\%} ± 2.6{\%}). A significant inverse correlation was found between the hepatic insulin extraction and the WHR (r = .5, P {\textgreater} .04), signifying the importance of fat distribution in insulin metabolism. The obese patients were subdivided into two subgroups according to their glucose tolerance; eight patients exhibited a normal tolerance and the remaining 10 were intolerant. While glucose effectiveness was significantly lower in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, there were no significant differences in insulin sensitivity in the two subgroups. The basal and total prehepatic and posthepatic insulin secretion was found to be significantly higher in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. We conclude that hyperinsulinemia in obesity is primarily caused by pancreatic $\beta$-cell hypersecretion, whereas diminished hepatic extraction of insulin only seems to be operative in patients with extreme upper-body fat distribution. In addition, basal hyperinsulinemia and a marked reduction in the ability of glucose to stimulate glucose uptake at basal insulin levels seem to be the main defects leading to impaired glucose tolerance. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with increased insulin sensitivity and reduced cardiovascular risk. We hypothesized that this relates to a direct effect of alcohol and therefore investigated whether acute alcohol intake altered insulin sensitivity or endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes. In an open-label two period design, the effect of a single oral dose of 40g of alcohol (168ml 40{\%} vodka) on an insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) and on endothelium-dependent (flow mediated, FMD) or endothelium-independent (glyceroltrinitrate (GTN)-induced) vasodilation of the brachial artery measured by ultrasound was studied. Experiments were carried out in twelve male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (64±6 years, body mass index 28.4±5.7kg/m 2). Baseline insulin sensitivity index (SI) was 1.10±0.34min-1.$\mu$U-1.ml, baseline FMD was +4.1±3.0{\%}, and GTN-induced vasodilation +7.4±2.3{\%} from resting brachial artery diameter. Acute alcohol intake increased alcohol plasma levels to 0.33±0.04‰, SI to 1.86±0.45min -1.$\mu$U-1.ml (p{\textless}0.05), and FMD to +8.2±2.8{\%} (p{\textless}0.05), while GTN-induced dilation remained unchanged. No relationship was detectable between the observed changes. We conclude that alcohol intake acutely increases endothelium-dependent brachial ar-tery vasodilation in patients with type 2 diabetes together with insulin sensitivity. This acute effect might explain some beneficial effects of low alcohol consumption in epidemiological observations. {\textcopyright} J. A.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine if immune mechanisms in GAD positive patients' contribute to the pathogenesis of a specific sub-type of Type 2 diabetes. GAD positive (n = 8) and GAD negative (n = 8) subjects diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes were matched for age, gender, body mass index, duration of diabetes and glycaemic control. All subjects underwent an insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test to measure insulin sensitivity and insulin secretory function with minimal model analysis. In addition, BRIN-BD11 clonal $\beta$-cells were supplemented with patients' sera to determine basal and alanine-stimulated insulin secretion and terminal complement complex (TCC) formation. Both groups were severely insulin resistant (0.56 ± 0.17 vs. 0.99 ± 0.33 10-4 min-1/($\mu$U ml-1) for GADneg and GADpos, respectively) but the GAD negative subjects had a higher basal (87 ± 11 vs. 58 ± 14 pmol l-1, p {\textless} 0.05) and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ($\Delta$AUCins 0.96 ± 0.12 vs. 0.60 ± 0.12 pmol/(l-1 min), p {\textless} 0.05). In vivo measures of insulin secretion were negatively correlated with TCC formation, independent of antibody status. In conclusion, GAD positive subjects initially diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes are unable to compensate for insulin resistance due to more pronounced $\beta$-cell impairment. TCC formation may be partly responsible for the insulin secretory dysfunction associated with this specific sub-type of Type 2 diabetes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Objectives. Elevated plasma endothelin (ET)-1 levels have been described in insulin-resistant states such as syndrome X, obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and in some studies in essential hypertension. To investigate whether increases in circulating ET-1 to levels observed in insulin-resistant states can modulate insulin levels and/or insulin sensitivity in humans, we assessed these variables during low, non-pressor-dose ET-1 compared with placebo infusion. Design. In a randomized, single blind, crossover design, 10 lean normotensive male subjects received either an intravenous infusion of subpressor doses of ET-1 dissolved in polygeline or a control infusion of polygeline only (placebo). Using dynamic assessment by the minimal model approach with the modified frequent sampling intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) the following and other parameters were measured: insulin sensitivity; acute insulin response to glucose (AIR(G)) calculated as the average of the three peak values between 2 and 5 min after injection of glucose from which the basal insulin levels were substracted; the initial area under the curve (AUC1-19) from insulin values between time 0 and 19 min and the first-phase insulin secretion ($\phi$1) from insulin kinetics parameters. Results. ET-1 infusion reduced AIR(G) (to 34.85 ± 4.27 compared with 49.3 ± 6.9 $\mu$U/ml during placebo, P = 0.017) and the acute C-peptide response to glucose (to 2.33 ± 0.41 compared with 3.1 ± 0.44 ng/ml, P = 0.018), decreased plasma insulin levels during the FSIGT compared with placebo (analysis of variance P {\textless} 0.0001) and decreased the AUC1-19 (to 2.1 ± 0.2 compared with 2.9 ± 0.3 U/l per 20 min, P {\textless} 0.01) while $\phi$1 tended to be lower. S(l) measured during ET-1 infusion was unaltered (11.11 ± 1.91 x 10-4 versus 10.88 ± 2.11 10-4/min per mU per l, NS). Conclusions. These findings demonstrate that an increase in circulating ET-1 to levels observed in insulin-resistant states acutely diminishes the insulin secretory response but does not significantly modify insulin sensitivity.},

abstract = {Intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) minimal model parameters are commonly estimated by weighted least squares (WLSs) on each subject data. Sometimes, with sparse data, individual parameters cannot be satisfactorily obtained. In such cases, a population approach could be preferable. These methods allow borrowing information across all subjects simultaneously, quantifying population features directly, and subsequently, deriving individual parameter estimates. In this paper, we assessed different estimation methods on simulated datasets. Besides the standard WLS approach, we applied iterative procedures (iterative two-stage (ITS) and global two-stage (GTS) methods) as well as nonlinear mixed-effects models (NLMEMs), where the likelihood is based on model linearization: first-order (FO), FO conditional estimation (FOCE), and Laplace (LAP) approximations. The synthetic dataset, initially very rich, was progressively reduced (by 50{\%} and 75{\%}) in order to assess the robustness of the results in sparsely sampled situations. Our results show that, even with intensive sampling, population approaches provide more reliable parameter estimates. Moreover, these estimates are remarkably more robust when the data become scarce. ITS and GTS encounter critical problems when single subjects have very poor sampling schedules, whereas the NLMEM (excluding FO) methods are more versatile and able to cope with such situations. FOCE appears as the most satisfactory approach. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) plays a critical role in regulating IgG homeostasis in vivo. There are mixed reports on whether modification of the interaction with FcRn can be used as an engineering strategy to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of monoclonal antibodies. We tested whether the T250Q/M428L mutations, which improved the pharmacokinetics of humanized IgGs in the rhesus monkey, would translate to a pharmacokinetic benefit in both cynomolgus monkeys and mice when constructed on a different humanized IgG framework (anti-tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$)). The T250Q/M428L anti-TNF$\alpha$ variant displayed an ∼40-fold increase in binding affinity to cynomolgus monkey FcRn (C-FcRn) at pH 6.0, with maintenance of the pH binding dependence. We also constructed another anti-TNF$\alpha$ variant (P257I/Q311I) whose binding kinetics with the C-FcRn was similar to that of the T250Q/M428L variant. The binding affinity of the T250Q/M428L variant for murine FcRn was increased ∼500-fold, with maintenance of pH dependence. In contrast to the interaction with C-FcRn, this interaction was driven mainly by a decrease in the rate of dissociation. Despite the improved in vitro binding properties of the anti-TNF$\alpha$ T250Q/M428L and P257I/Q311I variants to C-FcRn, the pharmacokinetic profiles of these molecules were not differentiated from the wild-type antibody in cynomolgus monkeys after intravenous administration. When administered intravenously to mice, the T250Q/M428L anti-TNF$\alpha$ variant displayed improved pharmacokinetics, characterized by an ∼2-fold slower clearance than the wild-type antibody. The discrepancy between these data and previously reported benefits in rhesus monkeys and the inability of these mutations to translate to improved kinetics across species may be related to a number of factors. We propose extending consideration to differences in the absolute IgG-FcRn affinity, the kinetics of the IgG/FcRn interaction, and differences in the relative involvement of this pathway in the context of other factors influencing the disposition or elimination of monoclonal antibodies. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Objective: NONMEM users typically demonstrate the adequacy of a model by displaying plots of PRED vs DV or IPRED vs DV along with weighted and unweighted residuals. These are often called the standard diagnostic plots. An alternative way of evaluating a model is to simulate from the final estimates and compare the distribution of the observations with the simulated distribution. A plot of the time course of the observations and prediction interval for the simulated values provides a visual predictive check. The objective of this report is to compare the standard diagnostic plots with the visual predictive check in terms of their ability to suggest improvements to the model structure and confirm the suitability of the final model.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMethods: Plasma warfarin concentrations and effects on prothrombin complex activity have been reported by O'Reilly et al. (1, 2). These data were fitted with a one compartment disposition model with first-order input and elimination plus either an immediate effect model, an effect compartment model or a turnover model. The turnover model is known a priori to be the most appropriate mechanistic model.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults: The standard diagnostic plots did not give a clear indication of the best model. There was some indication in the residual plot that the immediate effect model was not performing well at the time of the earliest post treatment prothrombin complex observation. The visual predictive check demonstrated the lack of fit of the direct and effect compartment models both for structural and stochastic components.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nConclusion: The standard diagnostic plots should be called Rorschach plots because their interpretation is dependent on the mind of the observer.

abstract = {The pharmacokinetics (PK) of biologic therapeutics, especially monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), in monkeys generally presents the most relevant predictive PK information for humans. However, human mAbs, xenogeneic proteins to monkeys, are likely to be immunogenic. Monkeys previously treated with a human mAb (nonna{\"{i}}ve) may have developed antidrug antibodies (ADAs) that crossreact with another test mAb in subsequent studies. Unlike PK studies for small-molecule therapeutics, in which animals may be reused, na{\"{i}}ve monkeys have been used almost exclusively for preclinical PK studies of biologic therapeutics to avoid potential pre-existing immunologic cross-reactivity issues. The propensity and extent of pre-existing ADAs have not been systematically investigated to date. In this study, the PK and immunogenicity of mAb A, a human anti-human interkeukin-17 mAb, were investigated in a colony of 31 cynomolgus monkeys previously exposed to other human mAbs against different targets. We screened the monkeys for pre-existing antibodies to mAb A prior to the PK study and showed that 44{\%} of the monkeys had pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies to mAb A, which could affect the PK characterization of the antibody. In the subcolony of monkeys without measurable preexisting ADAs, PK and immunogenicity of mAb A were successfully characterized. The impact of ADAs on mAb A PK was also demonstrated in the monkeys with pre-existing ADAs. Here we report the results and propose a pragmatic approach for the use of non-na{\"{i}}ve monkeys when conducting PK studies of biologic therapeutics.},

abstract = {We previously performed a comparative assessment of tissue-level vascular physiological parameters in mice and rats, two of the most commonly utilized species in translational drug development. The present work extends this effort to non-human primates by measuring tissue- and organ-level vascular volumes (Vv), interstitial volumes (Vi), and blood flow rates (Q) in cynomolgus monkeys. These measurements were accomplished by red blood cell labeling, extracellular marker infusion, and rubidium chloride bolus distribution, respectively, the same methods used in previous rodent measurements. In addition, whole-body blood volumes (BV) were determined across species. The results demonstrate that Vv, Vi, and Q, measured using our methods scale approximately by body weight across mouse, rat, and monkey in the tissues considered here, where allometric analysis allowed extrapolation to human parameters. Significant differences were observed between the values determined in this study and those reported in the literature, including Vv in muscle, brain, and skin and Q in muscle, adipose, heart, thymus, and spleen. The impact of these differences for selected tissues was evaluated via sensitivity analysis using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. The blood-brain barrier in monkeys was shown to be more impervious to an infused radioactive tracer, indium-111-pentetate, than in mice or rats. The body weight-normalized total BV measured in monkey agreed well with previously measured value in rats but was lower than that in mice. These findings have important implications for the common practice of scaling physiological parameters from rodents to primates in translational pharmacology.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives: Prediction of human pharmacokinetics for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) plays an important role for first-in-human (FIH) dose selection. This retrospective analysis compares observed FIH pharmacokinetic data for 16 mAbs to those predicted in humans based on allometric scaling of Cynomolgus monkey pharmacokinetic data. Methods: Ten mAbs exhibited linear pharmacokinetics in monkeys based on non-compartmental analysis. For these, simple allometric scaling based on bodyweight was applied to predict human clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) from those obtained in monkeys. Six mAbs exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics in monkeys based on population modelling. For these, a population modelling approach using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling software, NONMEM, was applied to describe monkey data by a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination from the central compartment. The pharmacokinetic parameters inmonkeys were then scaled tohumans based on simple allometry.Humanconcentrationtime profiles of these mAbs were then simulated and compared with those observed in the FIH studies. Results: Antibodies with linear elimination inmonkeys also exhibited linear elimination in humans. For these, observed CL and Vd were predicted within 2.3-fold by allometry. The predictability of human peak serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) for mAbs with nonlinear pharmacokinetics in monkeys was, however, concentration dependent. C max was consistently overestimated (up to 5.3-fold higher) when below the predicted Michaelis-Menten constant (Km; range 0.3-4 mg/mL). The prediction of human Cmax was within 2.3-fold when concentrations greatly exceeded Km. Similarly, differences between predicted human AUCs and those observed in the FIH studies were much greater at low doses/concentrations. Consequently, predicted drug exposure in humans at low starting doses (range 0.01-0.3mg/kg) in FIH studies was poorly estimated for three of sixmAbs with nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Conclusions: Allometric prediction of human pharmacokinetics may be sufficient for mAbs that exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. For mAbs that exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the best predictive performance was obtained after doses that achieved target-saturating concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare 2 stepwise covariate model-building strategies, frequently used in the analysis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) data using nonlinear mixed-effects models, with respect to included covariates and predictive performance. In addition, the effects of stepwise regression on the estimated covariate coefficients were assessed. Using simulated and real PK data, covariate models were built applying (1) stepwise generalized additive models (GAM) for identifying potential covariates, followed by backward elimination in the computer program NONMEM, and (2) stepwise forward inclusion and backward elimination in NONMEM. Different versions of these procedures were tried (eg, treating different study occasions as separate individuals in the GAM, or fixing a part of the parameters when the NONMEM procedure was used). The final covariate models were compared, including their ability to predict a separate data set or their performance in cross-validation. The bias in the estimated coefficients (selection bias) was assessed. The model-building procedures performed similarly in the data sets explored. No major differences in the resulting covariate models were seen, and the predictive performances overlapped. Therefore, the choice of model-building procedure in these examples could be based on other aspects such as analyst- and computer-time efficiency. There was a tendency to selection bias in the estimates, although this was small relative to the overall variability in the estimates. The predictive performances of the stepwise models were also reasonably good. Thus, selection bias seems to be a minor problem in this typical PK covariate analysis.},

abstract = {Ribavirin remains an important component of hepatitis C treatment in certain clinical scenarios, but it causes hemolytic anemia. A quantitative understanding of the ribavirin exposure-anemia relationship is important in dose individualization/optimization. We developed a model relating ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) exposure in red blood cells (RBCs), RBC lifespan, feedback regulation of RBC production when anemia occurs, and the resulting hemoglobin decline. Inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) and interleukin 28B (IL28B) genetics were found to be significant covariates. Clinical trial simulations predicted that anemia is least severe in IL28B non-CC (rs12979860, CT or TT), ITPA variant subjects, followed by IL28B non-CC, ITPA wild-type, IL28B CC, ITPA variant, and IL28B CC, ITPA wild-type subjects (most severe). Reducing the ribavirin dose from 1,200/1,000 mg to 800/600 mg could reduce the proportions of grade 2 anemia by about half. The resulting model framework will aid the development of dosing strategies that minimize the incidence of anemia in treatment regimens that include ribavirin.},

abstract = {Preclinical assessment of monoclonal antibody (mAb) disposition during drug development often includes investigations in non-human primate models. In many cases, mAb exhibit non-linear disposition that relates to mAb-target binding [i.e., target-mediated disposition (TMD)]. The goal of this work was to develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict non-linear mAb disposition in plasma and in tissues in monkeys. Physiological parameters for monkeys were collected from several sources, and plasma data for several mAbs associated with linear pharmacokinetics were digitized from prior literature reports. The digitized data displayed great variability; therefore, parameters describing inter-antibody variability in the rates of pinocytosis and convection were estimated. For prediction of the disposition of individual antibodies, we incorporated tissue concentrations of target proteins, where concentrations were estimated based on categorical immunohistochemistry scores, and with assumed localization of target within the interstitial space of each organ. Kinetics of target-mAb binding and target turnover, in the presence or absence of mAb, were implemented. The model was then employed to predict concentration versus time data, via Monte Carlo simulation, for two mAb that have been shown to exhibit TMD (2F8 and tocilizumab). Model predictions, performed a priori with no parameter fitting, were found to provide good prediction of dose-dependencies in plasma clearance, the areas under plasma concentration versu time curves, and the time-course of plasma concentration data. This PBPK model may find utility in predicting plasma and tissue concentration versus time data and, potentially, the time-course of receptor occupancy (i.e., mAb-target binding) to support the design and interpretation of preclinical pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic investigations in non-human primates.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate $\beta$-cell function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with overt (OH) and subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) before and after T4 replacement therapy. Background: Disturbances in glucose metabolism have been observed in hypothyroid states. However, the clinical significance and potential reversibility of these alterations by T4 replacement therapy remain to be elucidated especially in patients with SH. Design and patients: Parameters of glucose metabolism have been investigated in subjects with OH (n = 12) and SH (n = 11). Insulin sensitivity has been assessed by the euglycaemic- hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique and $\beta$-cell function by mathematical modelling of data derived from an oral glucose tolerance test. Results: Fasting and dynamic glycaemia as assessed by the AUCGlucose remained unaltered following substitution therapy (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Insulin sensitivity significantly improved only in subjects with OH (P {\textless} 0.05). Fasting insulin and proinsulin concentrations increased proportionally in both groups (P {\textless} 0.05) with the proinsulin : insulin ratio remaining unchanged (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Total insulin secretion was higher in OH before initiation of therapy (P {\textless} 0.05). In both groups, dynamic parameters including total insulin secretion, hepatic insulin extraction and the adaptation index were significantly attenuated (P {\textless} 0.05) after restoration of thyroid function, whereas the disposition index and the basal insulin secretion rate remained unaltered (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusion: In summary, SH and OH are characterized by attenuated basal plasma insulin levels and increased glucose-induced insulin secretion. T4 replacement therapy partially ameliorates the insulin secretion profile and reduces the demand on pancreatic $\beta$-cells after glucose challenge to an extent that exceeds any effect attributable to the improvement in insulin sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance is associated with atherosclerosis, and hyperinsulinemia is predictive of coronary heart disease. However, a quantitative estimation of in vivo insulin sensitivity in juvenile myocardial infarction is still lacking and the mechanism of hyperinsulinemia is unknown. We estimated insulin sensitivity, $\beta$-cell secretion, and hepatic insulin extraction using the minimal model analysis of a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) in 25 normal-weight subjects without glucose intolerance and hypertension who had an acute myocardial infarction before the age of 40 years, and 10 control subjects comparable for age, sex, body mass index, and blood pressure. All patients underwent a coronary angiography. Insulin sensitivity was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects (mean ± SEM, 4.6 ± 0.6 v 8.5 ± 1.2 10-4 {\textperiodcentered} min-1/($\mu$U/mL), P = .002). The basal C-peptide secretion rate (P = .02), total C-peptide secretion (P = .005), area under the curve (AUC) of insulin (P = .04) and C-peptide (P = .01), and hepatic insulin extraction (P = .04) were higher in patients versus control subjects. In conclusion, insulin resistance is evident in subjects with early myocardial infarction accurately selected to avoid the influence of other factors known to reduce insulin sensitivity, and hyperinsulinemia is due to an increase in $\beta$-cell secretion rather than a decrease in hepatic insulin extraction.

A frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test was performed in 20 elderly (E, 10/10 male/female, all 63 yr old) and in 20 young subjects (Y, 10/10 male/female, all 27 yr old), who were similar in body mass index and 2-h blood glucose during oral glucose tolerance test. E exhibited impaired glucose elimination (iv tolerance index, 1.31 ± 0.10 vs. 1.70 ± 0.12{\%} min-1; P = 0.019). First-phase insulin secretion and S(I) did not differ between the groups, whereas E had lower glucose sensitivity of second-phase insulin secretion (0.40 ± 0.07 vs. 0.70 ± 0.08 (pmol/L)min-2/(mmol/L), P = 0.026), lower S(G), 0.017 ± 0.002 vs. 0.025 ± 0.002 min-1, P = 0.004), and higher HE (81.3 ± 2.4 vs. 73.2 ± 2.1{\%}, P = 0.013). Across both groups, S(G) correlated positively with glucose tolerance index (r = 0.58, P {\textless} 0.001) and negatively with HE (r = -0.54, P {\textless} 0.001). Plasma leptin and glucagon did not change by age, whereas plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP) was higher in E (122 ± 18 vs.66 ± 6 pg/mL, P = 0.004). PP did not, however, correlate to any other parameter. We conclude that E subjects with normal oral glucose tolerance have reduced S(G), impaired second-phase insulin secretion, and increased HE, whereas S(I) and first-phase insulin secretion seem normal. S(G) seems most related to age- dependent impairment of glucose elimination, whereas leptin, glucagon, and PP do not seem to contribute.},

abstract = {One of the factors determining glucose tolerance is glucose disappearance independent from the dynamic insulin (glucose effectiveness); the debate on its role in the development of Type-2 diabetes is still open. The aim of the present study was to evaluate insulin delivery, insulin sensitivity (S(I)), and glucose effectiveness (S(G)) in a group of elderly Type-2 diabetic patients (D, 4/6 F/M, age 67±2 years, 64±2 kg, BMI 23.8±0.5 kg/m2), compared to young controls (C, 4/6 F/M, 25±2 years, 72±4 kg, 23.7±1.1 kg/m2) and elderly controls (E, 2/4 F/M, 73±3 years, 63±4 kg, 23.1±0.5 kg/m2). We performed oral (OGTT) and intravenous (FSIGT) glucose tolerance tests. The OGTT showed that C and E were normotolerant, while D had a markedly reduced glucose tolerance. This was also confirmed in the FSIGT where the glucose tolerance index (K(G)) was 0.6±0.1{\%} min-1 in D vs 1.8±0.2 in C and 1.5±0.2 in E (p{\textless}0.0002). Total insulin area of D and the overall insulin delivery were not different from those of the control groups. The early phase area was instead significantly reduced (0.19±0.02 mU min/mL vs 0.61±0.06 of C and 0.46±0.06 of E, p{\textless}0.001) given the reduction in the dynamic first-phase insulin delivery (0.86±0.17 min($\mu$U/mL)/(mg/dL) vs 3.95±0.61 in C (p{\textless}0.005) and 2.61±0.66 (p{\textless}0.001) in E). S(l) of D was 3.4±0.4 10-4min-1/($\mu$U/mL), not different from that of C (4.7±0.6) and E (3.5±0.2). This study showed a marked difference between S(G) of D and that of both control groups [0.010±0.001 min-1 vs 0.026±0.004 (p{\textless}0.001) of C and 0.020±0.003 (p{\textless}0.002) of E], mostly due to the zero-insulin component GEZI which was 0.006±0.001 in D vs 0.021±0.004 in C and 0.016±0.003 in E (p{\textless}0.003). In the elderly groups, when taken together, SG exhibited a positive correlation with the area under insulin concentration during the early phase and with K(G) (r=0.69, p=0.0032 and r=0.90, p=0.0001, respectively), demonstrating the importance of the first-phase insulin delivery in modulating glucose effectiveness and glucose tolerance.},

SB-240563 exhibited a relatively low plasma clearance of 0.1 mL/h/kg, a steady state volume of distribution of 60 mL/kg and a terminal half-life of 21 days. Since interleukin-5 (IL-5) is known to stimulate production, activation and maturation of eosinophils, eosinophil counts were measured. Following administration of SB240563, a persistent and dose dependent reduction in peripheral eosinophil counts relative to baseline was observed in the majority of patients who received the drug. A time delay of approximately 4 days was observed between maximal drug concentration and maximal decrease in eosinophil counts. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship between eosinophil count and drug concentration was characterized by an indirect effect model with inhibition of the production rate of response using a population approach. The estimated maximal decrease in eosinophil count was approximately 85{\%} from baseline and the concentration of drug resulting in halfmaximal effect on eosinophil count (IC50) was approximately 0.4 $\mu$g/mL. The combination of the long terminal half-life and the low IC50 allow for infrequent administration of SB-240563 in repeat dose clinical trials with sustained effects on circulating eosinophils.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The linear pharmacokinetics (PK) of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be considered a class property with values that are similar to endogenous IgG. Knowledge of these parameters across species could be used to avoid unnecessary in vivo PK studies and to enable early PK predictions and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) simulations. In this work, population-pharmacokinetic (popPK) modeling was used to determine a single set of ‘typical' popPK parameters describing the linear PK of mAbs in human, cynomolgus monkey and transgenic mice expressing the human neonatal Fc receptor (hFcRn Tg32), using a rich dataset of 27 mAbs. Non-linear PK was excluded from the datasets and a 2-compartment model was applied to describe mAb disposition. Typical human popPK estimates compared well with data from comparator mAbs with linear PK in the clinic. Outliers with higher than typical clearance were found to have non-specific interactions in an affinity-capture self-interaction nanoparticle spectroscopy assay, offering a potential tool to screen out these mAbs at an early stage. Translational strategies were investigated for prediction of human linear PK of mAbs, including use of typical human popPK parameters and allometric exponents from cynomolgus monkey and Tg32 mouse. Each method gave good prediction of human PK with parameters predicted within 2-fold. These strategies offer alternative options to the use of cynomolgus monkeys for human PK predictions of linear mAbs, based on in silico methods (typical human popPK parameters) or using a rodent species (Tg32 mouse), and call into question the value of completing extensive in vivo preclinical PK to inform linear mAb PK.},

abstract = {Interspecies allometric scaling is a useful tool for calculating human pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters from data in animals. In this study, in order to determine the scaling exponent in a simpleallometric equation that can predict human clearance (CL) and distribution volume at steady state (Vss) of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from monkey data alone, PK data of 24 mAbs were collected and analyzed according to the types of targeted antigens (soluble or membrane-bound antigens). Based on the observed PK data in humans (at clinical doses) and monkeys (at {\textgreater}1mg/kg), where the PK is expected to be linear, the mean scaling exponents in the allometric equation for CL and Vss, respectively, against body weight were calculated to be 0.79 and 1.12 [95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs): 0.690.89 and 0.961.28] for soluble antigens, and 0.96 and 1.00 (95{\%} CIs: 0.831.09 and 0.871.13) for membrane-bound antigens. Using these exponents and monkey PK data (at {\textgreater}1mg/kg) alone, both human CL and Vss of mAbs can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, i.e., within 2-fold of the observed values. Compared with traditional allometric scaling using PK data from three or more preclinical species, this approach is simple, quick, resource-saving, and useful in drug discovery and development. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Japanese Society for the Study of Xenobiotics (JSSX).},

Glucose was injected into conscious dogs at 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg. The measured time course of insulin was regarded as the 'input', and the falling glucose concentration as the 'output' of the physiological system storing and using glucose. Seven mathematical models of glucose uptake were compared to identify the representation most capable of simulating glucose disappearance. One specific nonlinear model was superior in that it: predicted the time course of glucose after glucose injection, had four parameters that could be precisely estimated, and described individual experiments with similar parameter values. Insulin sensitivity index (S(I)), defined as the dependence of fractional glucose disappearance on plasma insulin, was the ratio of two parameters of the chosen model and could be estimated with good reproducibility from the 300 mg/kg injection experiments (SI=7.00 x 10-4±24{\%} (coefficient of variation) min-1/$\mu$U/ml) (n=8). Thus, from a single glucose injection it is possible to obtain a quantitative index of insulin sensitivity that may have clinical applicability.},

abstract = {In recent years, many peptide- and protein-based biotherapeutics have been approved for subcutaneous (SC) delivery. The mechanisms and factors affecting the uptake and distribution of such large molecules following SC administration are not well understood. This review outlines the factors influencing uptake, transport, distribution and species differences following the SC administration of biotherapeutics; improved understanding of these factors will facilitate the appropriate selection of animal models and improve predictivity for the bioavailability of drugs in humans. Morphological differences between species, such as the presence or absence of the panniculus carnosus muscle, may have significant effects on SC delivery. Following SC administration, small molecules, peptides and small proteins (≤ 16 kDa) primarily diffuse through the blood vessel walls directly into capillaries, whereas large molecules are taken up into the more porous lymphatics. Critical parameters that may impact the availability in blood of compounds administered SC, other than molecular weight, include host-related factors, such as animal motility, age and gender, structural and functional characteristics of the SC interstitium and the lymphatics, and extrinsic factors, such as anesthesia, injection technique, potential precipitation or degradation at the injection site, and the use of SC delivery technology. A review of regulatory approval information for SC administered biotherapeutics is provided for comparison. Careful control of parameters during SC administration will reduce inter-individual and inter-species variability. {\textcopyright} Thomson Reuters (Scientific) Ltd.},

It can offer several advantages over intravenous administration. This notwithstanding, there remain critical development issues and knowledge gaps in SC drug delivery. To articulate and address these issues, the SC Drug Delivery and Development Consortium was convened in 2018 as a pre-competitive collaboration of industry experts in drug delivery, device development, and commercialization. In this review, we outline the Consortium's vision and mission in advancing the development of patient-centered biotherapeutics and establishing a collaborative organization that facilitates open sharing of information and gives voice to diverse viewpoints from SC experts across industries and disciplines. Additionally, we describe the current landscape and challenges associated with SC administration of therapeutic proteins (specifically monoclonal antibodies) and offer insights into potential solutions to these challenges within the context of 8 problem statements developed by the Consortium to highlight key gaps, unmet needs, and actionable issues. Current and future opportunities to accelerate progress in the field through technological advances and the development of drug delivery tools are also discussed.},

Owing to their clinical and commercial success, biologics are a rapidly growing class and have become a dominant therapeutic modality. Although most of the successful biologics to date are drugs that bear a peptidic backbone, ranging from small peptides to monoclonal antibodies ({\~{}}500 residues; 150 kDa), new biologic modalities, such as nucleotide-based therapeutics and viral gene therapies, are rapidly maturing towards widespread clinical use. Given the rise of peptides and proteins in the pharmaceutical landscape, tremendous research and development interest exists in developing less-invasive or non-invasive routes for the systemic delivery of biologics, including subcutaneous, transdermal, oral, inhalation, nasal and buccal routes. This Review summarizes the current status, latest updates and future prospects for such delivery of peptides, proteins and other biologics.},

abstract = {Many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were initially developed for intravenous (IV) administration. As a means to improve mAb drug-ability and the patient experience, subcutaneous (SC) administration is an increasingly important delivery route for mAbs. Unlike IV administration, bioavailability limitations for antibodies have been reported following SC injection and can dictate whether a mAb is administered via this parenteral route. The SC bioavailability of antibodies has been difficult to predict, and it can be variable and partial, with values ranging from {\~{}}50{\%} to 100{\%}. The mechanisms leading to the incomplete bioavailability of some mAbs relative to others are not well understood. There are some limited data that suggest the physiochemical properties inherent to a mAb can contribute to its SC absorption, bioavailability, and in vivo fate. In this study, we evaluated the integrated influence of multiple mAb physiochemical factors on the SC absorption and bioavailability of six humanized mAbs in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys. We demonstrate the physiochemical properties of mAbs are critical to their rate and extent of SC absorption. The combination of high positive charge and hydrophobic interaction significantly reduced the rate of the evaluated mAb's SC absorption and bioavailability. Reduction or balancing of both these attributes via re-engineering the mAbs restored desirable properties of the molecules assessed. This included reduced association with SC tissue, improvements in mAb absorption from the SC space and overall SC bioavailability. Our findings point to the importance of evaluating the relative balance between various physiochemical factors, including charge, hydrophobicity, and stability, to improve the SC drug-ability of mAbs for selecting or engineering mAbs with enhanced in vivo absorption and bioavailability following SC administration.},

abstract = {Background and objective: The subcutaneous injection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is increasingly used in the treatment of several diseases because of its convenience. Thus, a simple and accurate method of predicting the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies after a subcutaneous injection in humans would be a valuable tool for preclinical/clinical development. In this study, we investigated whether the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies after a subcutaneous injection in humans can be predicted using only pharmacokinetic data after a subcutaneous injection in cynomolgus monkeys. Methods: First, we compared the accuracy of three approaches to predict the apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) for 15 monoclonal antibodies in humans (1) allometric scaling from cynomolgus monkeys; (2) geometric mean of reported values in humans; (3) estimation from a regression line based on CL/F in humans [only Vd/F]). Then, using the predicted CL/F and Vd/F, and the geometric mean of reported absorption rate constant of mAbs the plasma concentration–time profiles of 13 monoclonal antibodies after subcutaneous injections in humans were simulated. Results: In a comparison of approaches, the first approach showed the best prediction accuracy for CL/F with an exponent of 0.9 (100{\%} and 73{\%} prediction accuracy within 2- and 1.5-fold of the observed value),and the third approach was the best for Vd/F (100{\%} prediction accuracy within 1.5-fold of the observed value). Next, using the first approach for CL/F and the third approach for Vd/F, we accurately predicted the plasma concentration–time profiles of 13 monoclonal antibodies after subcutaneous injections in humans. Conclusion: This simple approach can be applied in preclinical and clinical settings to predict the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies after subcutaneous injections in humans. Further, this approach requires only CL/F after a subcutaneous injection in cynomolgus monkeys, contributing to animal welfare and reducing costs.},

In addition to clinically validated immune cell re-targeting, bsAbs are being designed for tumor targeting and as dual immune modulators. Explorative preclinical and emerging clinical data indicate potential for enhanced efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity. However, bsAbs are a complex modality with challenges to overcome in early clinical trials, including selection of relevant starting doses using a minimal anticipated biological effect level approach, and predicting efficacious dose despite nonintuitive dose response relationships. Multiple factors can contribute to variability in the clinic, including differences in functional affinity due to avidity, receptor expression, effector to target cell ratio, and presence of soluble target. Mechanistic modeling approaches are a powerful integrative tool to understand the complexities and aid in clinical translation, trial design, and prediction of regimens and strategies to reduce dose limiting toxicities of bsAbs. In this tutorial, the use of mechanistic modeling to impact decision making for bsAbs is presented and illustrated using case study examples.},

abstract = {Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are increasingly used to support pediatric dose selection for small molecule drugs. In contrast, only a few pediatric PBPK models for therapeutic antibodies have been published recently, and the knowledge on the maturation of the processes relevant for antibody pharmacokinetics (PK) is limited compared to small molecules. The aim of this study was, thus, to evaluate predictions from antibody PBPK models for children which were scaled from PBPK models for adults in order to identify respective knowledge gaps. For this, we used the generic PBPK model implemented in PK-Sim without further modifications. Focusing on general clearance and distribution mechanisms, we selected palivizumab and bevacizumab as examples for this evaluation since they show simple, linear PK which is not governed by drug-specific target mediated disposition at usual therapeutic dosages, and their PK has been studied in pediatric populations after intravenous application. The evaluation showed that the PK of palivizumab was overall reasonably well predicted, while the clearance for bevacizumab seems to be underestimated. Without implementing additional ontogeny for antibody PK-specific processes into the PBPK model, bodyweight normalized clearance increases only moderately in young children compared to adults. If growth during aging at the time of the simulation was considered, the apparent clearance is approximately 20{\%} higher compared to simulations for which growth was not considered for newborns due to the long half-life of antibodies. To fully understand the differences and similarities in the PK of antibodies between adults and children, further research is needed. By integrating available information and data, PBPK modeling can contribute to reveal the relevance of involved processes as well as to generate and test hypothesis.},

abstract = {A modeling and simulation approach was used for quantitative comparison of a new generation HER2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC, PF-06804103) with trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1). To compare preclinical efficacy, the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of PF-06804103 and T-DM1 was determined across a range of mouse tumor xenograft models, using a tumor growth inhibition model. The tumor static concentration was assigned as the minimal efficacious concentration. PF-06804103 was concluded to be more potent than T-DM1 across cell lines studied. TSCs ranged from 1.0 to 9.8 µg/mL (n = 7) for PF-06804103 and from 4.7 to 29 µg/mL (n = 5) for T-DM1. Two experimental models which were resistant to T-DM1, responded to PF-06804103 treatment. A mechanism-based target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model was used to predict the human PK of PF-06804103. This model was constructed and validated based on T-DM1 which has non-linear PK at doses administered in the clinic, driven by binding to shed HER2. Non-linear PK is predicted for PF-06804103 in the clinic and is dependent upon circulating HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) concentrations. The models were translated to human and suggested greater efficacy for PF-06804103 compared to T-DM1. In conclusion, a fit-for-purpose translational PK/PD strategy for ADCs is presented and used to compare a new generation HER2 ADC with T-DM1.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this work was to investigate the role of the lymphatic system in the pharmacokinetics of etanercept, a fusion protein. Methods: Etanercept 1 mg/kg was administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC) to thoracic lymph duct-cannulated and sham-operated control rats. Blood and lymph samples were obtained for up to 6 days. Results: Model-based SC bioavailability of etanercept was 65.2{\%} in the control group. In lymph-cannulated rats, etanercept concentration in the lymph was consistently lower than in serum following IV dosing; and the concentration in the lymph was significantly higher than in serum after SC injection. The absorption occurred predominantly through the lymphatic pathway (82.7{\%}), and only 17.3{\%} by direct uptake into the central compartment (blood pathway). Lymphatic cannulation reduced the area under the serum concentration-time curve by 28{\%} in IV group and by 91{\%} in SC group. A mechanistic pharmacokinetic model that combined dual absorption pathways with redistribution of the systemically available protein drug into lymph was developed. The model successfully captured serum and lymph data in all groups simultaneously, and all parameters were estimated with sufficient precision. Conclusions: Lymphatic system was shown to play an essential role in systemic disposition and SC absorption of etanercept.},

We have developed an indirect-response pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model relating plasma siRNA (ALN-18328) levels to serum TTR reduction across five clinical studies. A sigmoidal function described this relationship, with estimated Hill coefficient of 0.548, and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), IC80, and IC90 values of 9.45, 118.5, and 520.5 ng/mL, respectively. Following patisiran 0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w), steady-state plasma ALN-18328 exposures were between IC80 and IC90, yielding average serum TTR reductions of 80{\%}-90{\%} from baseline. Covariate analysis indicated similar TTR reduction across evaluated intrinsic and extrinsic factors, obviating the need for dose adjustment. Modeling results support the recommended patisiran dosing schedule of 0.3 mg/kg q3w, with a maximum dose of 30 mg for patients weighing ≥100 kg.},

abstract = {How the genomic landscape of a tumor shapes and is shaped by anti-tumor immunity has  not been systematically explored. Using large-scale genomic data sets of solid tissue tumor biopsies, we quantified the cytolytic activity of the local immune infiltrate and identified associated properties across 18 tumor types. The number of predicted MHC Class I-associated neoantigens was correlated with cytolytic activity and was lower than expected in colorectal and other tumors, suggesting immune-mediated elimination. We identified recurrently mutated genes that showed positive association with cytolytic activity, including beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), HLA-A, -B and -C and Caspase 8 (CASP8), highlighting loss of antigen presentation and blockade of extrinsic apoptosis as key strategies of resistance to cytolytic activity. Genetic amplifications were also associated with high cytolytic activity, including immunosuppressive factors such as PDL1/2 and ALOX12B/15B. Our genetic findings thus provide evidence for immunoediting in tumors and uncover mechanisms of tumor-intrinsic resistance to cytolytic activity.},

Tumor genome analysis has revealed extreme heterogeneity among tumor missense mutation profiles, but their relevance to tumor immunology and patient outcomes has awaited comprehensive evaluation. Here, for 515 patients from six tumor sites, we used RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify mutations that are predicted to be immunogenic in that they yielded mutational epitopes presented by the MHC proteins encoded by each patient's autologous HLA-A alleles. Mutational epitopes were associated with increased patient survival. Moreover, the corresponding tumors had higher CTL content, inferred from CD8A gene expression, and elevated expression of the CTL exhaustion markers PDCD1 and CTLA4. Mutational epitopes were very scarce in tumors without evidence of CTL infiltration. These findings suggest that the abundance of predicted immunogenic mutations may be useful for identifying patients likely to benefit from checkpoint blockade and related immunotherapies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nivolumab was associated with higher rates of objective response than chemotherapy in a phase 3 study involving patients with ipilimumab-refractory metastatic melanoma. The use of nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma has not been tested in a phase 3 controlled study. METHODS: We randomly assigned 418 previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a BRAF mutation to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks and dacarbazine-matched placebo every 3 weeks) or dacarbazine (at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks and nivolumab-matched placebo every 2 weeks). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: At 1 year, the overall rate of survival was 72.9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 65.5 to 78.9) in the nivolumab group, as compared with 42.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 33.0 to 50.9) in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death, 0.42; 99.79{\%} CI, 0.25 to 0.73; P{\textless}0.001). The median progression-free survival was 5.1 months in the nivolumab group versus 2.2 months in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death or progression of disease, 0.43; 95{\%} CI, 0.34 to 0.56; P{\textless}0.001). The objective response rate was 40.0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 33.3 to 47.0) in the nivolumab group versus 13.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 9.5 to 19.4) in the dacarbazine group (odds ratio, 4.06; P{\textless}0.001). The survival benefit with nivolumab versus dacarbazine was observed across prespecified subgroups, including subgroups defined by status regarding the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Common adverse events associated with nivolumab included fatigue, pruritus, and nausea. Drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 11.7{\%} of the patients treated with nivolumab and 17.6{\%} of those treated with dacarbazine. CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab was associated with significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival, as compared with dacarbazine, among previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a BRAF mutation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab is a humanised antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)  monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1 and programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 and B7-1 interactions, reinvigorating anticancer immunity. We assessed its efficacy and safety versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (OAK) in 194 academic or community oncology centres in 31 countries. We enrolled patients who had squamous or non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, were 18 years or older, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had received one to two previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (one or more platinum based combination therapies) for stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease and those who had received previous treatments with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, or therapies targeting the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenously receive either atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks by permuted block randomisation (block size of eight) via an interactive voice or web response system. Coprimary endpoints were overall survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1-expression population TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 (≥1{\%} PD-L1 on tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells). The primary efficacy analysis was done in the first 850 of 1225 enrolled patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02008227. FINDINGS: Between March 11, 2014, and April 29, 2015, 1225 patients were recruited. In the primary population, 425 patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab and 425 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer with atezolizumab in the ITT and PD-L1-expression populations. In the ITT population, overall survival was improved with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel (median overall survival was 13{\textperiodcentered}8 months [95{\%} CI 11{\textperiodcentered}8-15{\textperiodcentered}7] vs 9{\textperiodcentered}6 months [8{\textperiodcentered}6-11{\textperiodcentered}2]; hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}73 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}62-0{\textperiodcentered}87], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0003). Overall survival in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population was improved with atezolizumab (n=241) compared with docetaxel (n=222; median overall survival was 15{\textperiodcentered}7 months [95{\%} CI 12{\textperiodcentered}6-18{\textperiodcentered}0] with atezolizumab vs 10{\textperiodcentered}3 months [8{\textperiodcentered}8-12{\textperiodcentered}0] with docetaxel; HR 0{\textperiodcentered}74 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}58-0{\textperiodcentered}93]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0102). Patients in the PD-L1 low or undetectable subgroup (TC0 and IC0) also had improved survival with atezolizumab (median overall survival 12{\textperiodcentered}6 months vs 8{\textperiodcentered}9 months; HR 0{\textperiodcentered}75 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}59-0{\textperiodcentered}96]). Overall survival improvement was similar in patients with squamous (HR 0{\textperiodcentered}73 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}54-0{\textperiodcentered}98]; n=112 in the atezolizumab group and n=110 in the docetaxel group) or non-squamous (0{\textperiodcentered}73 [0{\textperiodcentered}60-0{\textperiodcentered}89]; n=313 and n=315) histology. Fewer patients had treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events with atezolizumab (90 [15{\%}] of 609 patients) versus docetaxel (247 [43{\%}] of 578 patients). One treatment-related death from a respiratory tract infection was reported in the docetaxel group. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, OAK is the first randomised phase 3 study to report results of a PD-L1-targeted therapy, with atezolizumab treatment resulting in a clinically relevant improvement of overall survival versus docetaxel in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression or histology, with a favourable safety profile.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma have few treatment options  after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. In this trial, we assessed treatment with atezolizumab, an engineered humanised immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), in this patient population. METHODS: For this multicentre, single-arm, two-cohort, phase 2 trial, patients (aged ≥18 years) with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease had progressed after previous platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled from 70 major academic medical centres and community oncology practices in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria for enrolment were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, measurable disease defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), adequate haematological and end-organ function, and no autoimmune disease or active infections. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour specimens with sufficient viable tumour content were needed from all patients before enrolment. Patients received treatment with intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg, given every 3 weeks). PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) was assessed prospectively by immunohistochemistry. The co-primary endpoints were the independent review facility-assessed objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 and the investigator-assessed objective response rate according to immune-modified RECIST, analysed by intention to treat. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to assess whether the objective response rate was significantly higher than the historical control rate of 10{\%} at an $\alpha$ level of 0{\textperiodcentered}05. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02108652. FINDINGS: Between May 13, 2014, and Nov 19, 2014, 486 patients were screened and 315 patients were enrolled into the study. Of these patients, 310 received atezolizumab treatment (five enrolled patients later did not meet eligibility criteria and were not dosed with study drug). The PD-L1 expression status on infiltrating immune cells (ICs) in the tumour microenvironment was defined by the percentage of PD-L1-positive immune cells: IC0 ({\textless}1{\%}), IC1 (≥1{\%} but {\textless}5{\%}), and IC2/3 (≥5{\%}). The primary analysis (data cutoff May 5, 2015) showed that compared with a historical control overall response rate of 10{\%}, treatment with atezolizumab resulted in a significantly improved RECIST v1.1 objective response rate for each prespecified immune cell group (IC2/3: 27{\%} [95{\%} CI 19-37], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001; IC1/2/3: 18{\%} [13-24], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0004) and in all patients (15{\%} [11-20], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0058). With longer follow-up (data cutoff Sept 14, 2015), by independent review, objective response rates were 26{\%} (95{\%} CI 18-36) in the IC2/3 group, 18{\%} (13-24) in the IC1/2/3 group, and 15{\%} (11-19) overall in all 310 patients. With a median follow-up of 11{\textperiodcentered}7 months (95{\%} CI 11{\textperiodcentered}4-12{\textperiodcentered}2), ongoing responses were recorded in 38 (84{\%}) of 45 responders. Exploratory analyses showed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) subtypes and mutation load to be independently predictive for response to atezolizumab. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events, of which fatigue was the most common (five patients [2{\%}]), occurred in 50 (16{\%}) of 310 treated patients. Grade 3-4 immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 15 (5{\%}) of 310 treated patients, with pneumonitis, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, rash, and dyspnoea being the most common. No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study. INTERPRETATION: Atezolizumab showed durable activity and good tolerability in this patient population. Increased levels of PD-L1 expression on immune cells were associated with increased response. This report is the first to show the association of TCGA subtypes with response to immune checkpoint inhibition and to show the importance of mutation load as a biomarker of response to this class of agents in advanced urothelial carcinoma.

abstract = {T cell immunity directed against tumor-encoded amino acid substitutions occurs in  some melanoma patients. This implicates missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. However, a systematic evaluation of these putative neoantigens as targets of antitumor immunity is lacking. Moreover, it remains unknown whether vaccination can augment such responses. We found that a dendritic cell vaccine led to an increase in naturally occurring neoantigen-specific immunity and revealed previously undetected human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-restricted neoantigens in patients with advanced melanoma. The presentation of neoantigens by HLA-A*02:01 in human melanoma was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Vaccination promoted a diverse neoantigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in terms of both TCR-$\beta$ usage and clonal composition. Our results demonstrate that vaccination directed at tumor-encoded amino acid substitutions broadens the antigenic breadth and clonal diversity of antitumor immunity.},

The use of autologous antigen presenting cells transfected with in vitro transcribed RNA as stimulators allows in principle quantification of antigen-specific T-cells independent of the knowledge of the epitopes. We describe here a cytokine secretion assay that enables simultaneous assessment of both antigen-specific CD4+ as well as CD8+ T-cells directly from clinical samples without the need for generation of dendritic cells. To this aim, bulk PBMCs were electroporated with RNA encoding the antigen fused to trafficking signal sequences derived from a MHC class I molecule and used as stimulators. With human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) as antigen we show that for measuring ex vivo T-cell responses in ELISPOT and CFC such stimulators are superior or at least equivalent to a pool of overlapping peptides representing the entire pp65 sequence as well as to untagged pp65 encoding RNA. This approach avoids the time consuming generation of dendritic cells as immune stimulators and, in particular when used in the context of the CFC, is robust, broadly applicable and fast.},

However, elimination of cancer by T cells is only one step in the Cancer-Immunity Cycle, which manages the delicate balance between the recognition of nonself and the prevention of autoimmunity. Identification of cancer cell T cell inhibitory signals, including PD-L1, has prompted the development of a new class of cancer immunotherapy that specifically hinders immune effector inhibition, reinvigorating and potentially expanding preexisting anticancer immune responses. The presence of suppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment may explain the limited activity observed with previous immune-based therapies and why these therapies may be more effective in combination with agents that target other steps of the cycle. Emerging clinical data suggest that cancer immunotherapy is likely to become a key part of the clinical management of cancer.},

To unravel the genomic determinants of response to this therapy, we used whole-exome sequencing of non-small cell lung cancers treated with pembrolizumab, an antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden. In one responder, neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses paralleled tumor regression, suggesting that anti-PD-1 therapy enhances neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective cancer treatments, but  molecular determinants of clinical benefit are unknown. Ipilimumab and tremelimumab are antibodies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Anti-CTLA-4 treatment prolongs overall survival in patients with melanoma. CTLA-4 blockade activates T cells and enables them to destroy tumor cells. METHODS: We obtained tumor tissue from patients with melanoma who were treated with ipilimumab or tremelimumab. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on tumors and matched blood samples. Somatic mutations and candidate neoantigens generated from these mutations were characterized. Neoantigen peptides were tested for the ability to activate lymphocytes from ipilimumab-treated patients. RESULTS: Malignant melanoma exomes from 64 patients treated with CTLA-4 blockade were characterized with the use of massively parallel sequencing. A discovery set consisted of 11 patients who derived a long-term clinical benefit and 14 patients who derived a minimal benefit or no benefit. Mutational load was associated with the degree of clinical benefit (P=0.01) but alone was not sufficient to predict benefit. Using genomewide somatic neoepitope analysis and patient-specific HLA typing, we identified candidate tumor neoantigens for each patient. We elucidated a neoantigen landscape that is specifically present in tumors with a strong response to CTLA-4 blockade. We validated this signature in a second set of 39 patients with melanoma who were treated with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Predicted neoantigens activated T cells from the patients treated with ipilimumab. CONCLUSIONS: These findings define a genetic basis for benefit from CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma and provide a rationale for examining exomes of patients for whom anti-CTLA-4 agents are being considered.

abstract = {Cancer vaccines are a real application of the extensive knowledge of immunology to the field of oncology. Tumors are dynamic complex systems in which several entities, events, and conditions interact among them resulting in growth, invasion, and metastases. The immune system includes many cells and molecules that cooperatively act to protect the host organism from foreign agents. Interactions between the immune system and the tumor mass include a huge number of biological factors. Testing of some cancer vaccine features, such as the best conditions for vaccine administration or the identification of candidate antigenic stimuli, can be very difficult or even impossible only through experiments with biological models simply because a high number of variables need to be considered at the same time. This is where computational models, and, to this extent, immunoinformatics, can prove handy as they have shown to be able to reproduce enough biological complexity to be of use in suggesting new experiments. Indeed, computational models can be used in addition to biological models. We now experience that biologists and medical doctors are progressively convinced that modeling can be of great help in understanding experimental results and planning new experiments. This will boost this research in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013 Francesco Pappalardo et al.},

abstract = {Cancer vaccine feasibility would benefit from reducing the number and duration of vaccinations without diminishing efficacy. However, the duration of in vivo studies and the huge number of possible variations in vaccination protocols have discouraged their optimization. In this study, we employed an established mouse model of preventive vaccination using HER-2/neu transgenic mice (BALB-neuT) to validate in silico - designed protocols that reduce the number of vaccinations and optimize efficacy. With biological training, the in silico model captured the overall in vivo behavior and highlighted certain critical issues. First, although vaccinations could be reduced in number without sacrificing efficacy, the intensity of early vaccinations was a key determinant of long-term tumor prevention needed for predictive utility in the model. Second, after vaccinations ended, older mice exhibited more rapid tumor onset and sharper decline in antibody levels than young mice, emphasizing immune aging as a key variable in models of vaccine protocols for elderly individuals. Long-term studies confirmed predictions of in silico modeling in which an immune plateau phase, once reached, could be maintained with a reduced number of vaccinations. Furthermore, that rapid priming in young mice is required for long-term antitumor protection, and that the accuracy of mathematical modeling of early immune responses is critical. Finally, that the design and modeling of cancer vaccines and vaccination protocols must take into account the progressive aging of the immune system, by striving to boost immune responses in elderly hosts. Our results show that an integrated in vivo - in silico approach could improve both mathematical and biological models of cancer immunoprevention. {\textcopyright}2010 AACR.},

abstract = {Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that can be managed, but for which there is currently no cure. Recent discoveries, particularly in mouse models, indicate that targeted modulation of the immune response has the potential to move an individual from a diabetic to a long-term, if not permanent, healthy state. In this paper we develop a single compartment mathematical model that captures the dynamics of dendritic cells (DC and tDC), T cells (effector and regulatory), and macrophages in the development of type I diabetes. The model supports the hypothesis that differences in macrophage clearance rates play a significant role in determining whether or not an individual is likely to become diabetic subsequent to a significant immune challenge. With this model we are able to explore the effects of strengthening the anti-inflammatory component of the immune system in a vulnerable individual. Simulations indicate that there are windows of opportunity in which treatment intervention is more likely to be beneficial in protecting an individual from entering a diabetic state. This model framework can be used as a foundation for modeling future T1D treatments as they are developed.},

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease. Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50{\%} virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two separate RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, "all RBD-down" conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.},

abstract = {Therapeutic cancer vaccines often do not substantially reduce tumour burden, despite stimulating anti-tumour cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Recent experiments have shown that the majority of vaccine-elicited CTLs may be of low-avidity. Moreover, low-avidity CTLs, which are abundant, do not kill cancer cells and potentially inhibit the ability of high-avidity T cells to kill cancer cells. By modelling CTL selection using a system of ordinary differential equations, we show that the efficacy of the peptide vaccine may be improved by controlling its delivery and dosage to preferentially elicit high-avidity CTLs. Our simulations predict that weekly, reduced doses of a vaccine may result in a greater than 90{\%} reduction in cancer concentration. By contrast, a standard vaccine protocol such as a high-dose injection given every 2 weeks induces only a 65{\%} reduction. Our model demonstrates a proof-of-concept approach to targeting immune responses for CTL selection, thereby offering a technique to potentially improve existing therapies.},

abstract = {Optimal vaccine dosing is important to ensure the greatest protection and safety. Analysis of dose‐response data, from previous studies, may inform future studies to determine the optimal dose. Implementing more quantitative modelling approaches in vaccine dose finding have been recently suggested to accelerate vaccine development. Adenoviral vectored vaccines are in advanced stage of development for a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic indications, however dose‐response has not yet been systematically determined. To further inform adenoviral vectored vaccines dose identification, historical dose‐response data should be systematically reviewed. A systematic literature review was conducted to collate and describe the available dose‐response studies for adenovirus vectored vaccines. Of 2787 papers identified by Medline search strategy, 35 were found to conform to pre‐defined criteria. The majority of studies were in mice or humans and studied adenovirus serotype 5. Dose‐response data were available for 12 different immunological responses. The majority of papers evaluated three dose levels, only two evaluated more than five dose levels. The most common dosing range was 107–1010 viral particles in mouse studies and 108– 1011 viral particles in human studies. Data were available on adenovirus vaccine dose‐response, primarily on adenovirus serotype 5 backbones and in mice and humans. These data could be used for quantitative adenoviral vectored vaccine dose optimisation analysis.},

abstract = {Informative diagnostic tools are vital to the development of useful mixed-effects models. The Visual Predictive Check (VPC) is a popular tool for evaluating the performance of population PK and PKPD models. Ideally, a VPC will diagnose both the fixed and random effects in a mixed-effects model. In many cases, this can be done by comparing different percentiles of the observed data to percentiles of simulated data, generally grouped together within bins of an independent variable. However, the diagnostic value of a VPC can be hampered by binning across a large variability in dose and/or influential covariates. VPCs can also be misleading if applied to data following adaptive designs such as dose adjustments. The prediction-corrected VPC (pcVPC) offers a solution to these problems while retaining the visual interpretation of the traditional VPC. In a pcVPC, the variability coming from binning across independent variables is removed by normalizing the observed and simulated dependent variable based on the typical population prediction for the median independent variable in the bin. The principal benefit with the pcVPC has been explored by application to both simulated and real examples of PK and PKPD models. The investigated examples demonstrate that pcVPCs have an enhanced ability to diagnose model misspecification especially with respect to random effects models in a range of situations. The pcVPC was in contrast to traditional VPCs shown to be readily applicable to data from studies with a priori and/or a posteriori dose adaptations. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.},

In keeping with technological innovations, it discusses computer-based projections and slide shows as well as overhead projections. In particular, it discusses ways of organizing graphics and text in projected images and of using layout and design to present the information efficiently and effectively. Unlike other books that discuss technical presentations, this book anchors its advice in the experiences of scientists and engineers, including such successful presenters as Robert Oppenheimer, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, and Rita Levi-Montalcini, as well as currently active laboratory directors, scientists, and engineers. In addition to examining successful presentations, Alley also discusses the errors that cause many scientific presentations to flounder, providing a list of ten critical errors to avoid.

abstract = {The importance of precise information and knowledge on the initial estimates (IEs) in modeling has not been paid its due attention so far. By focusing on the IE, this tutorial may serve as a practical guide for beginners in pharmacometrics. A ‘good' set of IEs rather than arbitrary values is required because the IEs where NONMEM kicks off its estimation may influence the subsequent objective function minimization. To provide NONMEM with acceptable IEs, modelers should understand the exact meaning of THETA, OMEGA and SIGMA based on physiology. In practice, problems related to the value of the IE are more likely to occur for THETAs rather than the random-effect terms. Because it is almost impossible for a modeler to give a precise IE for OMEGAs at the beginning, it may be a good practice to start at relatively small IEs for them. NONMEM may fail to converge when too small IEs are provided for residual error parameters; thus, it is recommended to give sufficiently large values for them. The understandings on the roles, meanings and implications of IEs even help modelers in troubleshooting situations which frequently occur over the whole modeling process.},

abstract = {In recent years, many peptide- and protein-based biotherapeutics have been approved for subcutaneous (SC) delivery. The mechanisms and factors affecting the uptake and distribution of such large molecules following SC administration are not well understood. This review outlines the factors influencing uptake, transport, distribution and species differences following the SC administration of biotherapeutics; improved understanding of these factors will facilitate the appropriate selection of animal models and improve predictivity for the bioavailability of drugs in humans. Morphological differences between species, such as the presence or absence of the panniculus carnosus muscle, may have significant effects on SC delivery. Following SC administration, small molecules, peptides and small proteins (≤ 16 kDa) primarily diffuse through the blood vessel walls directly into capillaries, whereas large molecules are taken up into the more porous lymphatics. Critical parameters that may impact the availability in blood of compounds administered SC, other than molecular weight, include host-related factors, such as animal motility, age and gender, structural and functional characteristics of the SC interstitium and the lymphatics, and extrinsic factors, such as anesthesia, injection technique, potential precipitation or degradation at the injection site, and the use of SC delivery technology. A review of regulatory approval information for SC administered biotherapeutics is provided for comparison. Careful control of parameters during SC administration will reduce inter-individual and inter-species variability. {\textcopyright} Thomson Reuters (Scientific) Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of the clinical pharmacokinetics of new therapeutic entities facilitates decision making during drug discovery, and increases the probability of success for early clinical trials. Standard strategies employed for predicting the pharmacokinetics of small-molecule drugs (e.g., allometric scaling) are often not useful for predicting the disposition monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), as mAbs frequently demonstrate species-specific non-linear pharmacokinetics that is related to mAb-target binding (i.e., target-mediated drug disposition, TMDD). The saturable kinetics of TMDD are known to be influenced by a variety of factors, including the sites of target expression (which determines the accessibility of target to mAb), the extent of target expression, the rate of target turnover, and the fate of mAb-target complexes. In most cases, quantitative information on the determinants of TMDD is not available during early phases of drug discovery, and this has complicated attempts to employ mechanistic mathematical models to predict the clinical pharmacokinetics of mAbs. In this report, we introduce a simple strategy, employing physiologically-based modeling, to predict mAb disposition in humans. The approach employs estimates of inter-antibody variability in rate processes of extravasation in tissues and fluid-phase endocytosis, estimates for target concentrations in tissues derived through use of categorical immunohistochemical scores, and in vitro measures of the turnover of target and target-mAb complexes. Monte Carlo simulations were performed for four mAbs (cetuximab, figitumumab, dalotuzumab, trastuzumab) directed against three targets (epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). The proposed modeling strategy was able to predict well the pharmacokinetics of cetuximab, dalotuzumab, and trastuzumab at a range of doses, but trended towards underprediction of figitumumab concentrations, particularly at high doses. The general agreement between model predictions and experimental observations suggests that PBPK modeling may be useful for the a priori prediction of the clinical pharmacokinetics of mAb therapeutics.},

The primary objective of this work was a wide-scale evaluation of the predictive performance of IM PBPK models of therapeutic proteins. PBPK models for all administration routes available in the literature have regarded muscle as the total muscle (TM) in the body; however, anatomically, the body is composed of discrete muscle groups. Clinically, IM is administered to a specific muscle (SM). We explored the predictive performance of IM PBPK models with an SM or TM dosing site. The plasma concentration-time profiles of seven therapeutic proteins after an IM dose in humans served as the clinically observed data for model evaluation–this was a diverse group ranging from 30 to 149 kDa from six protein classes. Pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, tmax, AUC0-∞, and ka were estimated. SM and TM IM PBPK approaches were compared using Average Fold Error (AFE) and Pearson Chi-Square LineShape analyses. This work represents the first wide-scale validation of IM PBPK models and suggests that these models predict IM PBPK reasonably well. The SM and TM approach provided comparable performance.},

abstract = {Significant efforts are made to characterize molecular liabilities and degradation of the drug substance (DS) and drug product (DP) during various product life-cycle stages. The in vivo fate of a therapeutic protein is usually only considered in terms of pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs). However, the environment in the human body differs substantially from that of the matrix (formulation) of the DP and may impact on the stability of an injected therapeutic protein. Stabilizing excipients used in protein formulations are expected to undergo more rapid distribution and dissociation in vivo, compared to a protein as a highly charged macromolecule. Thus, in vivo stability may significantly differ from shelf-life stability. In vivo degradation of the therapeutic protein may alter efficacy and/or safety characteristics such as immunogenicity. Studying the stability of a therapeutic protein in the intended body compartment can de-risk drug development in early stages of development by improving the selection of better clinical lead molecules. This review assesses the considerations when aiming to evaluate the in vivo fate of a therapeutic protein by comparing the physiology of relevant human body compartments and assessing their potential implications on the stability of a therapeutic protein. Moreover, we discuss the limitations of current experimental approaches mimicking physiologic conditions, depending on the desired route of administration, such as intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC), intravitreal (IVT), or intrathecal (IT) administration(s). New models more closely mimicking the relevant physiologic environment and updated analytical methods are required to understand the in vivo fate of therapeutic proteins.},

The model features a detailed representation of absorption models for oral glucose, subcutaneous insulin and glucagon, and an insulin receptor model relating pharmacokinetic properties to pharmacodynamic effects. Model development and validation is based on literature data. The quality of predictions is high and captures relevant observed inter-and intra-individual variability.

The phase 1b PAVO study (NCT02519452) demonstrated that delivery of DARA with recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (rHuPH20) by subcutaneous (SC) infusion through a syringe pump (Part 1) or by manual SC injection (Part 2) was well tolerated with an efficacy profile consistent with IV DARA (Chari A, et al. ASH 2017; abstract 838). Aims:We present updated efficacy and safety data from Part 2. Methods: Eligible patients received ≥2 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug. In Part 2, patients received a concentrated co-formulation of DARA (DARA SC; 1,800 mg in 15 mL) and rHuPH20 (30,000 U) dose in a single, pre-mixed vial, which was administered in 3 to 5 minutes by manual SC injection. Primary endpoints were Ctrough of DARA at the end of weekly dosing on Cycle 3 Day 1 and safety. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, rate of complete response, time to response, and duration of response. Results: Patients in Part 2 (n=25) had a median age of 68 years and received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy. At a median follow-up of 4.6 months, none discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that DARA SC had a Tmax of approximately 72 hours and achieved similar or greater Ctrough on Cycle 3 Day 1 compared to what has been observed with DARA IV. Most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events ({\textgreater}1 patient) were lymphopenia (16{\%}), thrombocytopenia (8{\%}), and neutropenia (8{\%}). Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were reported in 3 (12{\%}) patients, all occurring within 6 hours of the first injection. No Grade 4 IRRs or discontinuations due to IRRs occurred. DARA SC injections in the periumbilical area were well tolerated with reversible erythema observed in 20{\%} of patients. DARA SC achieved an overall response rate of 44{\%}, including 28{\%} of patients achieving a very good partial response or better. Summary and Conclusions:DARA SC, which enables dosing in 3-5 minutes, was well tolerated with low IRR rates, had an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile, and demonstrated clinical response rates similar to DARA IV. Updated data based on longer follow-up will be presented at the meeting.},

Part 1 of the study, reported here, evaluated a mix-and-deliver (MD) formulation of daratumumab and rHuPH20 (DARA-MD) administered by subcutaneous infusion. Patients received subcutaneous daratumumab according to the approved IV monotherapy dosing schedule at 1200 mg (n 5 8) or 1800 mg (n 5 45). Primary end points were safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) variables. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with DARA-MD 1200 mg were thrombocytopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, insomnia, and decreased appetite (37.5{\%} each). Anemia (33.3{\%}), upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, and diarrhea (26.7{\%} each) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events with DARA-MD 1800 mg.

The subcutaneous route of administration is expected to improve convenience for patients and to reduce healthcare professional resource use compared with conventional intravenous infusion. Various non-clinical and clinical studies were conducted to support the bridge from the approved intravenous formulation to the novel subcutaneous treatment. The underlying hypothesis for these studies was that achieving subcutaneous rituximab serum trough concentrations that are at least as high as those reached with the intravenous formulation would result in at least the same degree of receptor saturation. Preclinical mouse xenograft and cynomolgus monkey B-cell depletion studies were performed at intravenous and subcutaneous doses that were previously found to result in comparable serum concentrations in pharmacokinetic studies in the same species. Results from these non-clinical assessments guided dose selection for the subsequent phase 1b dose finding trials in patients with follicular lymphoma as part of maintenance treatment. A fixed dose of 1 400 mg was found to result in noninferior serum trough concentrations to the intravenous formulation. Clinical trials in the induction setting in patients with follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are currently ongoing.},

The results of an earlier report based on therapeutic proteins, including mAbs, approved through the end of 2012 were inconclusive due to limited HI data available at that time. New HI data for mAbs or antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs; with a focus on the mAb component) available between 2013 and 2018 were evaluated. The investigation indicates there is almost no data for severe HI, limited data for moderate HI, and abundant data for mild HI. A significant exposure decrease was found for several mAbs or ADCs and a trend for decreasing area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was observed for other mAbs. Multiple potential mechanisms may contribute to the exposure decrease. Dose may need to be adjusted for patients with HI, after taking into account the exposure–response relationships for both efficacy and safety.},

abstract = {Human Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide. Disease transmission often occurs through the handling of domestic livestock, as well as ingestion of unpasteurized milk and cheese, but can have enhanced infectivity if aerosolized. Because there is no human vaccine available, rising concerns about the threat of Brucellosis to human health and its inclusion in the Center for Disease Control's Category B Bioterrorism/Select Agent List make a better understanding of the dose-response relationship of this microbe necessary. Through an extensive peer-reviewed literature search, candidate dose-response data were appraised so as to surpass certain standards for quality. The statistical programming language, "R," was used to compute the maximum likelihood estimation to fit two models, the exponential and the approximate beta-Poisson (widely used for quantitative risk assessment) to dose-response data. Dose-response models were generated for prevalent species of Brucella: Br. suis, Br. melitensis, and Br. abortus. Dose-response models were created for aerosolized Br. suis exposure to guinea pigs from pooled studies. A parallel model for guinea pigs inoculated through both aerosol and subcutaneous routes with Br. melitensis showed that the median infectious dose corresponded to a 30 colony-forming units (CFU) dose of Br. suis, much less than the N 50 dose of about 94 CFU for Br. melitensis organisms. When Br. melitensis was tested subcutaneously on mice, the N 50 dose was higher, 1,840 CFU. A dose-response model was constructed from pooled data for mice, rhesus macaques, and humans inoculated through three routes (subcutaneously/aerosol/intradermally) with Br. melitensis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract = {Salmonella is a key human pathogen worldwide, most often associated with food poisoning incidences. There is a small number of predominant serotypes found in human cases. The role of exposure in the epidemiology of Salmonella can be explained using dose-response assessment both for infection and acute enteric illness. Dose-response studies are traditionally based on human challenge experiments but an alternative is to use outbreak data. Such data were collected from the published literature which included estimates of the dose ingested and the attack rate. Separate dose-response models for infection and illness given infection were fitted using a multi-level statistical framework. These models incorporated serotype and susceptibility as categorical covariates, and adjusted for heterogeneity in exposure. The results indicate that both the risk of infection and the risk of illness given infection increase with dose. The dose-response model incorporating data from all outbreaks had an infection ID50 of 7 CFU's and illness ID50 of 36 CFUs. This is indicative of much higher infectivity and pathogenicity compared with feeding studies of healthy human volunteers with laboratory adapted strains. No differences were found in the outbreak models between serotypes and susceptibility categories. However, for serotypes other than S. Enteritidis or S. Typhimurium, results indicate that a minor proportion of individuals exposed will not fall ill even at high doses. The dose-response relations indicate that outbreaks are associated with higher doses making it more likely to have a higher attack rate. Applications of the dose-response model in outbreak situations where either dose or attack rate is missing were successfully used to clarify the epidemiology. Finally, the dose-response models described here can be readily used in quantitative microbiological risk assessment to predict human infection and illness rates. A simple Excel spreadsheet implementing the model has been prepared and is available from the authors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Mathematical relations describing the risk of infection after exposure to enteropathogens are important tools for the evaluation of the potential health risk from exposure via food and water. A quantitative description of the dose-response relation for Campylobacter jejuni with the Beta-Poisson model was fitted to experimental data of infection with Campylobacter jejuni (as determined by shedding of C. jejuni) obtained in human feeding studies performed by Black et al. The maximum likelihood estimates for the Beta-Poisson model parameters based on these data are: $\alpha$ = 0.145 and $\beta$ = 7.59. The fit of the model on the experimental data, was good: the difference between the likelihood obtained with the Beta-Poisson model and the maximum possible likelihood was not significant. The occurrence of symptoms of intestinal illness did not follow a similar dose-related trend. Overall, 22{\%} of the infected volunteers developed symptoms (diarrhea, fever). The highest illness-to-infection ratio was found at an intermediate dose (9 x 104). The dose-response relation and the illness-to-infection ratio appeared to differ between different C. jejuni isolates. The dose-response relation derived from feeding studies with a single isolate should therefore be considered indicative. The absence of experimental data in the low dose range resulted in a relatively large confidence interval at low. doses. However, in cases where the dose-response relation has been applied so far to estimate the health risk of exposure to C. jejunin water, the uncertainty in the dose-response relation was insignificant compared to the uncertainty in the exposure estimate.},

abstract = {Tissue vs. plasma concentration profiles have been generated from a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of monoclonal antibody (mAb). Based on the profiles, we hypothesized that a linear relationship between the plasma and tissue concentrations of non-binding mAbs could exist; and that the relationship may be generally constant irrespective of the absolute mAb concentration, time, and animal species being analyzed. The hypothesis was verified for various tissues in mice, rat, monkey, and human using mAb or antibody-drug conjugate tissue distribution data collected from diverse literature. The relationship between the plasma and various tissue concentrations was mathematically characterized using the antibody biodistribution coefficient (ABC). Estimated ABC values suggest that typically the concentration of mAb in lung is 14.9{\%}, heart 10.2{\%}, kidney 13.7{\%}, muscle 3.97{\%}, skin 15.7{\%}, small intestine 5.22{\%}, large intestine 5.03{\%}, spleen 12.8{\%}, liver 12.1{\%}, bone 7.27{\%}, stomach 4.98{\%}, lymph node 8.46{\%}, adipose 4.78{\%}, brain 0.351{\%}, pancreas 6.4{\%}, testes 5.88{\%}, thyroid 67.5{\%} and thymus is 6.62{\%} of the plasma concentration. The validity of using the ABC to predict mAb concentrations in different tissues of mouse, rat, monkey, and human species was evaluated by generating validation data sets, which demonstrated that predicted concentrations were within 2-fold of the observed concentrations. The use of ABC to infer tissue concentrations of mAbs and related molecules provides a valuable tool for investigating preclinical or clinical disposition of these molecules. It can also help eliminate or optimize biodistribution studies, and interpret efficacy or toxicity of the drug in a particular tissue. {\textcopyright} 2013 Landes Bioscience.},

The research method that used is the study of literatures and the Focus Group Discussion (FGD). The research site is flood-prone areas, which is 4 (four) regencies in East Java Province, Indonesia. All of them have a high flood-prone index. In conclusion, sustainable flood management requires a multi-stakeholder involvement and participation of communities simultaneously. Flood management should be done with a systematic approach, and synergy of the various parties in efforts to cope with the disaster. Therefore, strengthening the sense of crisis, commitment, role and collective responsibility, and continuity of cooperation / collaboration in the context of governance network and capacity building is needed to maintain the sustainability of effective flood management},

abstract = {In covariate (sub)models of population pharmacokinetic models, most covariates are normalized to the median value; however, for body weight, normalization to 70 kg or 1 kg is often applied. In this article, we illustrate the impact of normalization weight on the precision of population clearance (CL pop ) parameter estimates. The influence of normalization weight (70, 1 kg or median weight) on the precision of the CL pop estimate, expressed as relative standard error (RSE), was illustrated using data from a pharmacokinetic study in neonates with a median weight of 2.7 kg. In addition, a simulation study was performed to show the impact of normalization to 70 kg in pharmacokinetic studies with paediatric or obese patients. The RSE of the CL pop parameter estimate in the neonatal dataset was lowest with normalization to median weight (8.1{\%}), compared with normalization to 1 kg (10.5{\%}) or 70 kg (48.8{\%}). Typical clearance (CL) predictions were independent of the normalization weight used. Simulations showed that the increase in RSE of the CL pop estimate with 70 kg normalization was highest in studies with a narrow weight range and a geometric mean weight away from 70 kg. When, instead of normalizing with median weight, a weight outside the observed range is used, the RSE of the CL pop estimate will be inflated, and should therefore not be used for model selection. Instead, established mathematical principles can be used to calculate the RSE of the typical CL (CL TV ) at a relevant weight to evaluate the precision of CL predictions.},

abstract = {Background: Allometric scaling is often used to describe the covariate model linking total body weight (WT) to clearance (CL); however, there is no consensus on how to select its value. Objectives: The aims of this study were to assess the influence of between-subject variability (BSV) and study design on (1) the power to correctly select the exponent from a priori choices, and (2) the power to obtain unbiased exponent estimates. Methods: The influence of WT distribution range (randomly sampled from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988–1994 [NHANES III] database), sample size (N = 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 subjects), and BSV on CL (low 20{\%}, normal 40{\%}, high 60{\%}) were assessed using stochastic simulation estimation. A priori exponent values used for the simulations were 0.67, 0.75, and 1, respectively. Results: For normal to high BSV drugs, it is almost impossible to correctly select the exponent from an a priori set of exponents, i.e. 1 vs. 0.75, 1 vs. 0.67, or 0.75 vs. 0.67 in regular studies involving {\textless} 200 adult participants. On the other hand, such regular study designs are sufficient to appropriately estimate the exponent. However, regular studies with {\textless} 100 patients risk potential bias in estimating the exponent. Conclusion: Those study designs with limited sample size and narrow range of WT (e.g. {\textless} 100 adult participants) potentially risk either selection of a false value or yielding a biased estimate of the allometric exponent; however, such bias is only relevant in cases of extrapolating the value of CL outside the studied population, e.g. analysis of a study of adults that is used to extrapolate to children.},

Without any mechanical stimulation, subcutaneously injected 200 nm liposomes are usually trapped in the interstitial space for prolonged time. However, upon lymphotropic stimulation (such as manual massage of the injection site), the liposomes can be mobilized into the blood via lymphatic pathway. Up to 40{\%} of the injected dose can be delivered to the blood via lymphatic pathway from the injection site at the rabbit's front paw dorsum during 5 min manual massage cycle. Using vasoconstricting hormone angiotensin II as liposome-encapsulated pharmacological marker, we demonstrated that physiological response to encapsulated drug (average blood pressure increase) can also be induced and modulated by massage. Massage itself was found to have no effect on the blood pressure. Modification of liposome surface with polyethylene glycol was found to increase blood localization of the liposome-encapsulated drug presumably due to decreasing the uptake of the drug carrier by lymph node macrophages. Pressure-dependent gags between lymphatic capillary endothelial cells are thought to play the role of the size discrimination device allowing larger particulates into the lymphatics and, eventually, into the blood after increase of interstitial pressure caused by injection site massage.},

The pharmacokinetics of IgGs is intimately linked to the recycling mechanism of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). For long serum half-life of therapeutic IgGs, the highly pH-dependent interaction with FcRn needs to be balanced to allow efficient FcRn binding and release at slightly acidic pH and physiological pH, respectively. Some IgGs, like the antibody briakinumab has an unusually short half-life of ∼8 days. Here we dissect the molecular origins of excessive FcRn binding in therapeutic IgGs using a combination of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and FcRn affinity chromatography. We provide experimental evidence for a two-pronged IgG-FcRn binding mechanism involving direct FcRn interactions with both the Fc region and the Fab regions of briakinumab, and correlate the occurrence of excessive FcRn binding to an unusually strong Fab-FcRn interaction.},

Our hFcRn quantification data from Tg32 mice will enable a more refined PBPK model to improve the accuracy of human PK predictions for Fc-containing biotherapeutics.},

abstract = {Rates of fluid pinocytosis by bovine aortic endothelial cells were measured during various manipulations of growth status in vitro. Sparsely seeded cultures grew exponentially until a confluent monolayer was formed, at which time growth slowed. This change in growth rate coincided with a decline in the rate of pinocytosis to about one‐third that in the growing cultures. During the subsequent attainment of maximal cell density in the confluent monolayer, the pinocytic rate remained constant. There was close correlation between 3H‐thymidine labelling indices, as measured by autoradiography, and the rates of pinocytosis. Mechanical “wounding” of the confluent monolayer resulted in cell migration and proliferation. Twenty‐four hours after “wounding,” rates of pinocytosis per mg. cell protein were significantly enhanced. When regeneration of the monolayer was blocked by cytochalasin B, pinocytosis remained at the same rate as in the uninjured, confluent monolayer. These experiments support, and extend to endothelium, earlier observations that in growing cells pinocytosis proceeds at a higher rate than in non‐growing, quiescent cells. Furthermore, they raise the possibility that the transendothelial transport of macromolecules such as lipoproteins by receptor‐in‐dependent fluid pinocytosis in vivo may be altered by the growth status of the endothelium.

IVIVR was developed using mechanistic deconvolution for a MR drug product to evaluate the in vivo effect of a proposed change in dissolution specification. The predictability of the IVIVR was evaluated and PE were below 10{\%}; however, external validation was not possible due to the lack of data. The developed PBPK absorption model and IVIVR were used to predict plasma concentration profiles and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for a hypothetical formulation with 0{\%} of drug dissolved in 2 h in in vitro dissolution test. Both methods predicted the insignificant effect of a change in in vitro dissolution profile on in vivo product performance. The bioequivalence of a hypothetical formulation to the test product was evaluated using virtual clinical trial. The performed analysis supported the proposed change in dissolution specification. A validated PBPK absorption model was proposed as an adequate alternative to IVIVC, when IVIVC could not have been developed according to the guidelines.},

abstract = {Objectives: The selection of sample times for a pharmacokinetic study is important when trapezoidal integration (e.g. non-compartmental analysis) is used to determine the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC). The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm that determines optimal times that provide the most accurate AUC by minimising trapezoidal integration error. Methods: The algorithm required initial single individual or mean pooled concentration data but did not specifically require a prior pharmacokinetic model. Optimal sample intervals were determined by minimising trapezoidal error using a genetic algorithm followed by a quasi-Newton method. The method was evaluated against simulated and clinical datasets to determine the method's ability to estimate the AUC. Key findings: The sample times produced by the algorithm were able to accurately estimate the AUC of pharmacokinetic profiles, with the relative AUC having 90{\%} confidence intervals of 0.919–1.05 for profiles with two-compartment kinetics. When comparing the algorithm with rich sampling (e.g. phase I trial), the algorithm provided equivalent or superior sample times with fewer observations. Conclusions: The creation of the algorithm and its companion web application allows users with limited pharmacometric or programming training can obtain optimal sampling times for pharmacokinetic studies.},

Four mice from each of four different mouse strains (nude, NOG, C57BL/6, CB-17 SCID (SCID)) were imaged weekly for one month. Images were acquired with a 3D balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) sequence. The volume of the lymph nodes and spleens were measured from MR images. In images of nude and SCID mice, lymph nodes sometimes contained a hyperintense region visible on MRI images. Volumes of the nodes were highly variable in nude mice. Nodes in SCID mice were smaller than in nude or C57Bl/6 mice (p{\textless}0.0001). Lymph node volumes changed slightly over time in all strains. The spleens of C57Bl/6 and nude mice were similar in size and appearance. Spleens of SCID and NOG mice were significantly smaller (p{\textless}0.0001) and abnormal in appearance. The MRI appearance of the normal lymph nodes and spleen varies considerably in the various mouse strains examined in this study. This is important to recognize in order to avoid the misinterpretation of MRI findings as abnormal when these strains are used in MRI imaging studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Economopoulos et al.},

abstract = {Recent advances in several areas are rekindling interest and enabling progress in the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines. These advances have been made in target selection, vaccine technology, and methods for reversing the immunosuppressive mechanisms exploited by cancers. Studies testing different tumor antigens have revealed target properties that yield high tumor versus normal cell specificity and adequate immunogenicity to affect clinical efficacy. A few tumor-associated antigens, normal host proteins that are abnormally expressed in cancer cells, have been demonstrated to serve as good targets for immunotherapies, although many do not possess the needed specificity or immunogenicity. Neoantigens, which arise from mutated proteins in cancer cells, are truly cancer-specific and can be highly immunogenic, though the vast majority are unique to each patient's cancer and thus require development of personalized therapies. Lessons from previous cancer vaccine expeditions are teaching us the type and magnitude of immune responses needed, as well as vaccine technologies that can achieve these responses. For example, we are learning which vaccine approaches elicit the potent, balanced, and durable CD4 plus CD8 T cell expansion necessary for clinical efficacy. Exploration of interactions between the immune system and cancer has elucidated the adaptations that enable cancer cells to suppress and evade immune attack. This has led to breakthroughs in the development of new drugs, and, subsequently, to opportunities to combine these with cancer vaccines and dramatically increase patient responses. Here we review this recent progress, highlighting key steps that are bringing the promise of therapeutic cancer vaccines within reach.},

abstract = {Purpose: The B-cell antigen CD20 provides a target for antibody-based positron emission tomography (immunoPET). We engineered antibody fragments targeting human CD20 and studied their potential as immunoPET tracers in transgenic mice (huCD20TM) and in a murine lymphoma model expressing human CD20. Experimental Design: Anti-CD20 cys-diabody (cDb) and cys-minibody (cMb) based on rituximab and obinutuzumab (GA101) were radioiodinated and used for immunoPET imaging of a murine lymphoma model. Pairwise comparison of obinutuzumab-based antibody fragments labeled with residualizing (89Zr) versus non-residualizing (124I) radionuclides by region of interest analysis of serial PET images was conducted both in the murine lymphoma model and in huCD20TM to assess antigen modulation in vivo. Results:124I-GAcDb and 124I-GAcMb produced high-contrast immunoPET images of B-cell lymphoma and outperformed the respective rituximab-based tracers. ImmunoPET imaging of huCD20TM showed specific uptake in lymphoid tissues. The use of the radiometal 89Zr as alternative label for GAcDb and GAcMb yielded greater target-specific uptake and retention compared with 124I-labeled tracers. Pairwise comparison of 89Zr- and 124I-labeled GAcDb and GAcMb allowed assessment of in vivo internalization of CD20/antibody complexes and revealed that CD20 internalization differs between malignant and endogenous B cells. Conclusions: These obinutuzumab-based PET tracers have the ability to noninvasively and quantitatively monitor CD20-expression and have revealed insights into CD20 internalization upon antibody binding in vivo. Because they are based on a humanized mAb they have the potential for direct clinical translation and could improve patient selection for targeted therapy, dosimetry prior to radioimmunotherapy, and prediction of response to therapy.},

abstract = {The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of therapeutic antibodies directly affect efficacy, dose and dose intervals, application route and tissue penetration. In indications where health-care providers and patients can choose between several efficacious and safe therapeutic options, convenience (determined by dosing interval or route of application), which is mainly driven by PK properties, can affect drug selection. Therapeutic antibodies can have greatly different PK even if they have identical Fc domains and show no target-mediated drug disposition. Biophysical properties like surface charge or hydrophobicity, and binding to surrogates for high abundant off-targets (e.g., baculovirus particles, Chinese hamster ovary cell membrane proteins) were proposed to be responsible for these differences. Here, we used heparin chromatography to separate a polyclonal mix of endogenous human IgGs (IVIG) into fractions that differ in their PK properties. Heparin was chosen as a surrogate for highly negatively charged glycocalyx components on endothelial cells, which are among the main contributors to nonspecific clearance. By directly correlating heparin retention time with clearance, we identified heparin chromatography as a tool to assess differences in unspecific cell–surface interaction and the likelihood for increased pinocytotic uptake and degradation. Building on these results, we combined predictors for FcRn-mediated recycling and cell–surface interaction. The combination of heparin and FcRn chromatography allow identification of antibodies with abnormal PK by mimicking the major root causes for fast, non-target-mediated, clearance of therapeutic, Fc-containing proteins.},

Because engineering can provide therapeutics that are more convenient, safer, and more efficacious for patients in several disease areas, it is an attractive approach to provide significant benefits to patients. Further advances in engineering mAbs to modulate their pharmacokinetics were driven by the increase of total soluble target antigen concentration that is often observed after injecting a mAb, which then requires a high dosage to antagonize. To decrease the required dosage, several antibody engineering techniques have been invented that reduce the total concentration of soluble target antigen. Here, we review the various ways that antibody engineering can improve the pharmacokinetic properties of mAbs.},

abstract = {The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has been demonstrated to contribute to a high bioavailability of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study, we explored the cellular sites of FcRn-mediated protection after subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) administration. SC absorption and IV disposition kinetics of a mAb were studied in hFcRn transgenic (Tg) bone marrow chimeric mice in which hFcRn was restricted to radioresistant cells or hematopoietic cells. SC bioavailabilities close to 90{\%} were observed in hFcRn Tg mice and chimeric mice with hFcRn expression in hematopoietic cells, whereas SC bioavailabilities were markedly lower when FcRn was missing in hematopoietic cells. Our study demonstrates: 1) FcRn in radiosensitive hematopoietic cells is required for high SC bioavailability, indicating first-pass catabolism after SC administration by hematopoietic cells; 2) FcRn-mediated transcytosis or recycling by radioresistent cells is not required for high SC bioavailability; and 3) after IV administration hematopoietic and radioresistent cells contribute about equally to clearance of the mAb. A pharmacokinetic model was devised to describe a mixed elimination via radioresistent and hematopoietic cells from vascular and extravascular compartments, respectively. Overall, the study indicates a relevant role of hematopoietic cells for first-pass clearance of mAbs after SC administration and confirms their role in the overall clearance of mAbs.},

abstract = {Two-pore PBPK models have been used for characterizing the PK of protein therapeutics since 1990s. However, widespread utilization of these models is hampered by the lack of a priori parameter values, which are typically estimated using the observed data. To overcome this hurdle, here we have presented the development of a two-pore PBPK model using de novo derived parameters. The PBPK model was validated using plasma PK data for different size proteins in mice. Using the “two pore theory” we were able to establish the relationship between protein size and key model parameters, such as: permeability-surface area product (PS), vascular reflection coefficient ($\sigma$), peclet number (Pe), and glomerular sieving coefficient ($\theta$). The model accounted for size dependent changes in tissue extravasation and glomerular filtration. The model was able to a priori predict the PK of 8 different proteins: IgG (150 kDa), scFv-Fc (105 kDa), F(ab)2 (100 kDa, minibody (80 kDa), scFv2 (55 kDa), Fab (50 kDa), diabody (50 kDa), scFv (27 kDa), and nanobody (13 kDa). In addition, the model was able to provide unprecedented quantitative insight into the relative contribution of convective and diffusive pathway towards trans-capillary mass transportation of different size proteins. The two-pore PBPK model was also able to predict systemic clearance (CL) versus Molecular Weight relationship for different size proteins reasonably well. As such, the PBPK model proposed here represents a bottom-up systems PK model for protein therapeutics, which can serve as a generalized platform for the development of truly translational PBPK model for protein therapeutics.},

abstract = {The serum half-life and clearance of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are critical factors that impact their efficacy and optimal dosing regimen. The pH-dependent binding of an mAb to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has long been recognized as an important determinant of its pharmacokinetics. However, FcRn affinity alone is not a reliable predictor of mAb half-life, suggesting that other biologic or biophysical mechanisms must be accounted for. mAb thermal stability, which reflects its unfolding and aggregation propensities, may also relate to its pharmacokinetic properties. However, no rigorous statistical regression methods have been used to identify combinations of physical parameters that best predict biologic properties. In this work, a panel of eight mAbs with published human pharmacokinetic data were selected for biophysical analyses of FcRn binding and thermal stability. Biolayer interferometry was used to characterize FcRn/mAb binding at acidic and neutral pH, while differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine thermodynamic unfolding parameters. Individual binding or stability parameters were generally weakly correlated with half-life and clearance values. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to identify the combination of two parameters with the best correlation to half-life and clearance as being the FcRn binding response at pH 7.0 and the change in heat capacity. Leave-one-out subsampling yielded a root mean square difference between observed and predicted half-life of just 2.7 days (16{\%}). Thus, the incorporation of multiple biophysical parameters into a cohesive model may facilitate early-stage prediction of in vivo half-life and clearance based on simple in vitro experiments.},

abstract = {The off-target distribution of anticancer nanoparticles to fibroblasts creates a barrier to the effective treatment of desmoplastic tumors. However, we hypothesized that this nanoparticle detriment might be exploited to target the expression of secreted cytotoxic proteins from tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF) as an anticancer strategy. In addressing this hypothesis, plasmids encoding the secretable TNF-related factor sTRAIL were loaded into lipid-coated protamine DNA complexes and administered by infusion in a murine xenograft model of human desmoplastic bladder carcinoma. Three doses were sufficient to generate approximately 70{\%} of TAFs as sTRAIL-producing cells. sTRAIL triggered apoptosis in tumor cell nests adjacent to TAFs. Furthermore, it reverted residual fibroblasts to a quiescent state due to insufficient activation, further compromising tumor growth and remodeling the microenvironment to favor second-wave nanotherapy. We confirmed the efficacy of this strategy in an orthotopic xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer, where the desmoplastic stroma is well known to be a major barrier to the delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles. Collectively, our results offer a proof of concept for the use of nanoparticles to modify TAFs as an effective strategy to treat desmoplastic cancers. Cancer Res; 77(3); 719-31. {\'{O}}2016 AACR.},

abstract = {The effective combination of drugs promoting antiangiogenesis and apoptosis effects has proven to be a promising collaborative tumor antidote; and the codelivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) and chemotherapy agents within one efficient vehicle has gained more attention over single regimen administration. Herein, vascular endothelial growth factor specific siRNA (siVEGF) and paclitaxel (PTX) were introduced as therapeutic companions and coencapsulated into naturally mimic high-density lipoproteins (rHDL/siVEGF-PTX), so that various mechanisms of treatment can occur simultaneously. The terminal nanoparticles share capacity of specific-targeting to tumor cells overexpressed scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and deliver siVEGF and PTX into cytoplasm by a nonendocytosis mechanism. By exchanging HDL core lipids with hydrophobic therapeutics, rHDL/siVEGF-PTX possessed particle size of ∼160 nm, surface potential of ∼-20 mV, and desirable long-term storage stability. In vitro results confirmed that the parallel activity of siVEGF and PTX displayed enhanced anticancer efficacy. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of rHDL/siVEGF-PTX toward human breast cancer MCF-7 cell is 0.26 $\mu$g/mL (PTX concentration), which presents a 14.96-fold increase in cytotoxicity by taking Taxol as comparison. Moreover, in vivo results further demonstrated that rHDL/siVEGF-PTX performed enhanced tumor growth inhibition via natural targeting pathway, accompanied by remarkable inhibition of neovascularization in situ caused by siVEGF silencing in down-regulation of VEGF proteins. On the premise of effective drug codelivery, rHDL/siVEGF-PTX demonstrated high tumor targeting for collaborative antitumor efficacy without side effects after systemic administration, and this bioinspired strategy could open an avenue for exploration of combined anticancer therapy.},

Human eccrine sweat is a surprisingly biomarker-rich fluid which is gaining increasing attention. This is especially true in applications of continuous bio-monitoring where other biofluids prove more challenging, if not impossible. However, much confusion on the topic exists as the microfluidics of the eccrine sweat gland has never been comprehensively presented and models of biomarker partitioning into sweat are either underdeveloped and/or highly scattered across literature. Reported here are microfluidic models for eccrine sweat generation and flow which are coupled with review of blood-to-sweat biomarker partition pathways, therefore providing insights such as how biomarker concentration changes with sweat flow rate. Additionally, it is shown that both flow rate and biomarker diffusion determine the effective sampling rate of biomarkers at the skin surface (chronological resolution). The discussion covers a broad class of biomarkers including ions (Na+, Cl-, K+, NH4+), small molecules (ethanol, cortisol, urea, and lactate), and even peptides or small proteins (neuropeptides and cytokines). The models are not meant to be exhaustive for all biomarkers, yet collectively serve as a foundational guide for further development of sweat-based diagnostics and for those beginning exploration of new biomarker opportunities in sweat.},

Sweat contamination during interstitial fluid glucose (IG) extraction affects the accuracy of glucose AUC measurement, because this technology uses extracted sodium ion levels as an internal standard. Therefore, we developed a sweat monitoring patch to reduce this effect and investigated its efficacy in volunteers undergoing oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Materials and Methods: Fifty diabetes mellitus inpatients and 10 healthy subjects undergoing the 75 g OGTT were included. Two sites on the forearm were pretreated with microneedle arrays, then hydrogels for interstitial fluid extraction were placed on the treated sites. Simultaneously, hydrogels for sweat monitoring were placed on untreated sites near the treated sites. Plasma glucose (PG) levels were measured every 30 min for 2 h to calculate reference AUC values. Using MIET, IG AUC was calculated from extracted glucose and sodium ion levels after attachment of the hydrogel for 2 h. {\textcopyright} Diabetes Technology Society.},

This report describes progress on a physiologically based transport model relating sweat glucose and key electrolyte concentrations to those in blood.

Sweat glucose was measured with a novel, prototype skin sweat collection/analysis system and blood glucose with a commercial fingerstick glucometer. These data, in combination with data from 3 published studies, were used to calibrate a dynamic mathematical model for glucose transport and uptake in human skin, followed by extraction into sweat. Model simulations revealed that experimental and literature sweat glucose values were well represented under varying physiologic conditions. The glucose model, calibrated under a variety of experimental conditions including electrical enhancement, revealed a 10 min blood-to-sweat lag time and a sweat/blood glucose level ranging from 0.001 to 0.02, depending on the sweat rate. These values are consistent with those reported in the literature. The developed model satisfactorily described the sweat-to-blood relationship for glucose concentrations measured under different conditions in 4 human studies including the present pilot study.

abstract = {The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Recent studies have shown that the FcRn-IgG interaction can be modulated to alter the pharmacokinetics of the antibody. This has been achieved by altering amino acid residues in the FcRn-binding domain of the antibody, resulting in a change in the pH-dependent binding affinity of the antibody to FcRn. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the pH-dependent FcRn binding affinity on the pharmacokinetics of the antibody with changes in the N434 residue. Two anti-TNFalpha mAb FcRn variants (N434A and N434H) were engineered and pharmacokinetic studies of the two FcRn variants together with the wild-type (WT) were conducted in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. N434A, which had similar binding properties to murine FcRn as WT, had the same pharmacokinetic profile as WT in mice. N434H, with the highest binding affinity to murine FcRn at pH 7.4, had a faster clearance (16.1 mL/day/kg) and a lower bioavailability (61.3{\%}) compared to WT (5.07 mL/day/kg, 73.2{\%}) and N434A (5.90 mL/day/kg, 72.4{\%}) in mice. N434A and N434H, which had higher binding affinity at pH 6.0 to monkey FcRn with comparable affinity at pH 7.4, had significantly higher AUC(Days 0-7) compared to WT (749 +/- 71.9 and 819 +/- 81.5 vs. 592 +/- 56.8 mug/mL.day) in monkeys. Thus, increasing the binding affinity of mAb to FcRn at pH 6.0 while keeping a low binding affinity at pH 7.4 improves the pharmacokinetics of these molecules.},

Live-cell and electron microscopy experiments together with cell-free assays have allowed us to describe the characteristics of the delivery process and determine the core protein machinery required for fusion. The ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery is required for MVB biogenesis. The HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting) complex is required for endosome-lysosome tethering and a trans-SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptor) complex including the R-SNARE VAMP7 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 7) mediates endosome-lysosome membrane fusion. Protein-binding partners of VAMP7 including the clathrin adaptors AP-3 (adaptor protein 3) and Hrb (HIV Rev-binding protein) are required for its correct intracellular localization and function. Overall, co-ordination of the activities of ESCRT, HOPS and SNARE complexes are required for efficient delivery of endocytosed macromolecules to lysosomes.

abstract = {The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) promotes antibody recycling through rescue from normal lysosomal degradation. The binding interaction is pH-dependent with high affinity at low pH, but not under physiological pH conditions. Here, we combined rational design and saturation mutagenesis to generate novel antibody variants with prolonged half-life and acceptable development profiles. First, a panel of saturation point mutations was created at 11 key FcRn-interacting sites on the Fc region of an antibody. Multiple variants with slower FcRn dissociation kinetics than the wildtype (WT) antibody at pH 6.0 were successfully identified. The mutations were further combined and characterized for pH-dependent FcRn binding properties, thermal stability and the Fc$\gamma$RIIIa and rheumatoid factor binding. The most promising variants, YD (M252Y/T256D), DQ (T256D/T307Q) and DW (T256D/T307W), exhibited significantly improved binding to FcRn at pH 6.0 and retained similar binding properties as WT at pH 7.4. The pharmacokinetics in human FcRn transgenic mice and cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that these properties translated to significantly prolonged plasma elimination half-life compared to the WT control. The novel variants exhibited thermal stability and binding to Fc$\gamma$RIIIa in the range comparable to clinically validated YTE and LS variants, and showed no enhanced binding to rheumatoid factor compared to the WT control. These engineered Fc mutants are promising new variants that are widely applicable to therapeutic antibodies, to extend their circulation half-life with obvious benefits of increased efficacy, and reduced dose and administration frequency.},

abstract = {F.W.R. Brambell deduced the existence of a protective receptor for IgG, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), long before its discovery in the early to mid-1990s. With the coincident, explosive development of IgG-based drugs, FcRn became a popular target for tuning the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). One aspect of Brambell's initial observation, however, that is seldom discussed since the discovery of the receptor, is the compliance in the mechanism that Brambell observed (saturating at 10s-100s of $\mu$M concentration), vs. the comparative stiffness of the receptor kinetics (saturating in the nM range for most species). Although some studies reported that increasing the already very high Fc-FcRn affinity at pH 6.0 further improved mAb half-life, in fact the results were mixed, with later studies increasingly implicating non-FcRn-dependent mechanisms as determinants of mAb pharmacokinetics. Mathematical modelling of the FcRn system has also indicated that the processes determining the pharmacokinetics of mAbs have more nuances than had at first been hypothesised. We propose, in keeping with the latest modelling and experimental evidence reviewed here, that the dynamics of endosomal sorting and trafficking have important roles in the compliant salvage mechanism that Brambell first observed nearly 50 years ago, and therefore also in the pharmacokinetics of mAbs. These ideas lead to many open questions regarding the endosomal trafficking of both FcRn and mAbs and also to what properties of a mAb can be altered to achieve an improvement in pharmacokinetics. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is a key determinant of IgG homeostasis. It binds to the Fc domain of IgG in a strictly pH-dependent manner and protects IgG from lysosomal degradation. The impact of FcRn salvage pathway on IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) pharmacokinetics (PK) has been well established. In this report, a set of mAbs with wild-type human Fc sequences but different Fab domains were used to examine the potential impact of Fab domain on in vitro FcRn binding and in vivo PK. We were surprised to find that mAbs with the same wild-type human Fc sequences but different Fab domains were shown to bind FcRn with considerable differences in both the binding at acidic pH and the dissociation at neutral pH, suggesting that the Fab domain may also have an impact on FcRn interaction. For these mAbs, no relationship between the FcRn binding affinity at acidic pH and in vivo PK was found. Instead, an apparent correlation between the in vitro FcRn dissociation at neutral pH and the in vivo PK in human FcRn mice, nonhuman primates and humans was observed. Our results suggested that the Fab domain of mAbs can affect their interaction with FcRn and thus their pharmacokinetic properties and that in vitro FcRn binding/dissociation assays can be a useful screening tool for pharmacokinetic assessment of mAbs with wild-type Fc sequences.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the prediction of human plasma concentrations after dermal application using in vitro permeation parameters obtained from excised human skin. The in vitro skin permeability of 7 marketed drug products was evaluated. The plasma concentration-time profiles of the drug substances in humans after their dermal application were simulated using compartment models and the clinical pharmacokinetic parameters. The transdermal process was simulated using the in vitro skin permeation rate and lag time assuming a zero-order absorption. These simulated plasma concentration profiles were compared with the clinical data. The result revealed that the steady-state plasma concentration of diclofenac and the maximum concentrations of nicotine, bisoprolol, rivastigmine, and lidocaine after topical application were within 2-fold of the clinical data. Furthermore, the simulated concentration profiles of bisoprolol, nicotine, and rivastigmine reproduced the decrease in absorption due to drug depletion from the formulation. In conclusion, this simple compartment model using in vitro human skin permeation parameters as zero-order absorption predicted the human plasma concentrations accurately.},

abstract = {The purpose of this comprehensive review is to: 1) review the physiology of sweat gland function and mechanisms determining the amount and composition of sweat excreted onto the skin surface; 2) provide an overview of the well-established thermoregulatory functions and adaptive responses of the sweat gland; and 3) discuss the state of evidence for potential non-thermoregulatory roles of sweat in the maintenance and/or perturbation of human health. The role of sweating to eliminate waste products and toxicants seems to be minor compared with other avenues of excretion via the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract; as eccrine glands do not adapt to increase excretion rates either via concentrating sweat or increasing overall sweating rate. Studies suggesting a larger role of sweat glands in clearing waste products or toxicants from the body may be an artifact of methodological issues rather than evidence for selective transport. Furthermore, unlike the renal system, it seems that sweat glands do not conserve water loss or concentrate sweat fluid through vasopressin-mediated water reabsorption. Individuals with high NaCl concentrations in sweat (e.g. cystic fibrosis) have an increased risk of NaCl imbalances during prolonged periods of heavy sweating; however, sweat-induced deficiencies appear to be of minimal risk for trace minerals and vitamins. Additional research is needed to elucidate the potential role of eccrine sweating in skin hydration and microbial defense. Finally, the utility of sweat composition as a biomarker for human physiology is currently limited; as more research is needed to determine potential relations between sweat and blood solute concentrations.},

To address cell heterogeneity, we propose a multiscale modeling approach - from in vitro to preclinical and clinical studies - to develop cell-type-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models. A physiologically based mechanistic modeling approach integrating data from aqueous solutions, U87 glioma cells, mice, and cancer patients was utilized to characterize the brain disposition of temozolomide (TMZ), the cornerstone of chemotherapy against glioblastoma multiforme. The final model represented intracellular normal brain and brain tumor compartments in which TMZ pH-dependent conversion to the DNA-alkylating species leads to the formation of DNA adducts that serve as an entry point for a PD model. This multiscale protocol can be extended to account for TMZ PK-PD in different cell populations, thus providing a critical tool to personalize TMZ-based chemotherapy on a cell-type-specific basis. {\textcopyright} 2014 ASCPT All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although skin is the largest organ of the human body, cutaneous drug metabolism is often overlooked, and existing experimental models are insufficiently validated. This proof-of-concept study investigated phase II biotransformation of 11 test substrates in fresh full-thickness human skin explants, a model containing all skin cell types. Results show that skin explants have significant capacity for glucuronidation, sulfation, N-acetylation, catechol methylation, and glutathione conjugation. Novel skin metabolites were identified, including acyl glucuronides of indomethacin and diclofenac, glucuronides of 17$\beta$-estradiol, N-acetylprocainamide, and methoxy derivatives of 4-nitrocatechol and 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene. Measured activities for 10 $\mu$M substrate incubations spanned a 1000-fold: from the highest 4.758 pmol•mg skin-1•h-1 for p-toluidine N-acetylation to the lowest 0.006 pmol•mg skin-1•h-1 for 17$\beta$-estradiol 17-glucuronidation. Interindividual variability was 1.4- to 13.0-fold, the highest being 4-methylumbelliferone and diclofenac glucuronidation. Reaction rates were generally linear up to 4 hours, although 24-hour incubations enabled detection of metabolites in trace amounts. All reactions were unaffected by the inclusion of cosubstrates, and freezing of the fresh skin led to loss of glucuronidation activity. The predicted whole-skin intrinsic metabolic clearances were significantly lower compared with corresponding whole-liver intrinsic clearances, suggesting a relatively limited contribution of the skin to the body's total systemic phase II enzymemediated metabolic clearance. Nevertheless, the fresh full-thickness skin explants represent a suitable model to study cutaneous phase II metabolism not only in drug elimination but also in toxicity, as formation of acyl glucuronides and sulfate conjugates could play a role in skin adverse reactions.},

Skin is frequently in contact with PAHs and data on the metabolic capacity of skin tissue toward these compounds are inconclusive. We compared BP metabolism in excised human skin, commercially available in vitro 3D skin models and primary 2D skin cell cultures, and analyzed the metabolically catalyzed occurrence of seven different BP follow-up products by means of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). All models investigated were competent to metabolize BP, and the metabolic profiles generated by ex vivo human skin and skin models were remarkably similar. Furthermore, the genotoxicity of BP and its derivatives was monitored in these models via comet assays. In a full-thickness skin, equivalent BP-mediated genotoxic stress was generated via keratinocytes. Cultured primary keratinocytes revealed a level of genotoxicity comparable with that of direct exposure to 50-100nM of BPDE. Our data demonstrate that the metabolic capacity of human skin ex vivo, as well as organotypic human 3D skin models toward BP, is sufficient to cause significant genotoxic stress and thus cutaneous bioactivation may potentially contribute to mutations that ultimately lead to skin cancer. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

Thirty six subjects, including 20 sedentary controls and 16 long-distance runners (with 7-12 years of athletic training, average 9.2±2.1 years) were observed. Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) with iontophoresis (2 mA for 5 min) and 10{\%} acetylcholine (ACh) were performed to determine axon reflex-mediated and directly activated (DIR, muscarinic receptor) sweating. Sweat onset time, sweat rate, number of activated sweat glands, sweat output per gland and skin temperature were measured at rest while maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) were measured during maximal cycling. Sweat rate, activated sweat glands, sweat output per gland, skin temperature and VO2max were significantly higher in the trained runners than in the sedentary controls. Sweat onset time was significantly shorter for the runners. In the group of long-distance runners, significant correlations were found between VO 2max and sweat onset time (r2 = 0.543, P{\textless}0.01, n = 16), DIR sweat rate (r2 = 0.584, P{\textless}0.001, n = 16), sweat output per gland (r2 = 0.539, P{\textless}0.01, n = 16). There was no correlation between VO2max and activated sweat glands. These findings suggest that habitual long-distance running results in upregulation of the peripheral sweating mechanisms in humans. Additional research is needed to determine the molecular mechanism underlying these changes. These findings complement the existing sweating data in long-distance runners. {\textcopyright} 2014 Lee et al.},

The maximal sweat rate and pK(A) for Mch determined from the dose-response curve for each individual were compared with the anatomic dimensions of the isolated secretory tubules. There was significant correlation between Mch sensitivity (pK(A)) and the size of the sweat gland, sweat rate per gland, sweat rate per unit length of the secretory tubule, and sweat rate per unit glandular volume. The sweat glands from individuals judged to be poor sweaters exhibited smaller size, lower secretory activity both in vivo and in vitro, and decreased Mch sensitivity compared with glands from physically fit individuals. We conclude that the increased Mch sensitivity and glandular hypertrophy are the two important features of functionally active sweat glands and infer that these parameters could improve as a result of acclimatization to physical exercise and/or heat.},

Understanding the transcriptome and proteome of sweat glands is important for Understanding their physiology and role in diseases. However, no systematic transcriptome or proteome analysis of sweat glands has yet been reported. Here, we isolated eccrine sweat glands from human skin by microdissection and performed RNA-seq and proteome analysis. In total, 138,000 transcripts and 6,100 proteins were identified. Comparison of the RNA-seq data of eccrine sweat glands to other human tissues revealed the closest resemblance to the cortex region of kidneys. The proteome data showed enrichment of proteins involved in secretion, reabsorption, and woUnd healing. Importantly, protein level identification of the calcium ion channel TRPV4 suggests the importance of eccrine sweat glands in re-epithelialization of woUnds and prevention of dehydration. We also identified 2 previously missing proteins from our analysis. Using a proteogenomic approach, we identified 7 peptides from 5 novel genes, which we validated using synthetic peptides. Most of the novel proteins were from short open reading frames (sORFs) suggesting that many sORFs still remain to be annotated in the human genome.

Although the incidence of sweat gland dysfunction might appear of minor importance, it can be a real concern for people with either hypohidrosis or hyperhidrosis. However, sweat gland function remains relatively poorly explored. Objectives To investigate the function of single human sweat glands. Methods We describe a new approach for noninvasive imaging of single sweat gland activity in human palms in vivo up to a depth of 100 $\mu$m, based on nonlinear two-photon excited autofluorescence (TPEF) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). Results These techniques appear to be useful compared with approaches already described for imaging single sweat gland activity, as they allow better three-dimensional spatial resolution of sweat pore inner morphology and real-time monitoring of individual sweat events. By filling the sweat pore with oil and tuning the CARS contrast at 2845 cm-1, we imaged the ejection of sweat droplets from a single sweat gland when oil is pushed out by sweat flow. On average, sweat events lasted for about 30 s every 3 min under the conditions studied. On the other hand, about 20{\%} of sweat glands were found inactive. TPEF and CARS were also used to study, at the single pore level, the antiperspirant action of aluminium chlorohydrate (ACH) and to reveal, for the first time in vivo, the formation of a plug at the pore entrance, in agreement with reported ACH antiperspirant mechanisms. Conclusions Although data were acquired on human palms, these techniques show great promise for a better understanding of sweat secretion physiology and should be helpful to improve the efficacy of antiperspirant formulations.},

abstract = {Noninvasive, in situ biochemical monitoring of physiological status, via the use of sweat, could enable new forms of health care diagnostics and personalized hydration strategies. Recent advances in sweat collection and sensing technologies offer powerful capabilities, but they are not effective for use in extreme situations such as aquatic or arid environments, because of unique challenges in eliminating interference/contamination from surrounding water, maintaining robust adhesion in the presence of viscous drag forces and/or vigorous motion, and preventing evaporation of collected sweat. This paper introduces materials and designs for waterproof, epidermal, microfluidic and electronic systems that adhere to the skin to enable capture, storage, and analysis of sweat, even while fully underwater. Field trials demonstrate the ability of these devices to collect quantitative in situ measurements of local sweat chloride concentration, local sweat loss (and sweat rate), and skin temperature during vigorous physical activity in controlled, indoor conditions and in open-ocean swimming.},

abstract = {Non-invasive and accurate access of biomarkers remains a holy grail of the biomedical community. Human eccrine sweat is a surprisingly biomarker-rich fluid which is gaining increasing attention. This is especially true in applications of continuous bio-monitoring where other biofluids prove more challenging, if not impossible. However, much confusion on the topic exists as the microfluidics of the eccrine sweat gland has never been comprehensively presented and models of biomarker partitioning into sweat are either underdeveloped and/or highly scattered across literature. Reported here are microfluidic models for eccrine sweat generation and flow which are coupled with review of blood-to-sweat biomarker partition pathways, therefore providing insights such as how biomarker concentration changes with sweat flow rate. Additionally, it is shown that both flow rate and biomarker diffusion determine the effective sampling rate of biomarkers at the skin surface (chronological resolution). The discussion covers a broad class of biomarkers including ions (Na+, Cl-, K+, NH4+), small molecules (ethanol, cortisol, urea, and lactate), and even peptides or small proteins (neuropeptides and cytokines). The models are not meant to be exhaustive for all biomarkers, yet collectively serve as a foundational guide for further development of sweat-based diagnostics and for those beginning exploration of new biomarker opportunities in sweat.},

Seasonal variation and hyperhydrosis are possibly correlated to occurrence of HFS. Therefore, we proposed to study the prevalence of HFS in different seasons retrospectively and to study the relationship between sunitinib sweat secretion and HFS prospectively. Patients and methods: A retrospective cohort of 19 patients treated with sunitinib was used to determine seasonal prevalence of HFS. In a prospective study, sunitinib and N-desethyl sunitinib levels in sweat patches of 25 patients treated with sunitinib were quantified and correlated to severity of HFS. Results: In the retrospective cohort, the patients suffered from more severe HFS during summertime compared with the rest of the year. In the prospective study, the cumulative amounts of sunitinib plus metabolite measured in the patches of the ontreatment phase (median 129.4 ng/patch) were higher than the off-treatment phase (median 39.5 ng/patch). A tendency was observed towards increasing amounts of drug per patch with increasing severity of HFS. Conclusion: Patients experienced more HFS in summer time compared to other seasons. However, no statistically significant correlation between sunitinib sweat secretion and severity of HFS could be demonstrated within our patient cohort. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

Within the framework of a project evaluating the use of alternative biological matrices for therapeutic monitoring of psychoactive drugs in paediatric and non-paediatric individuals, the excretion of ATX and its principal metabolites has been recently studied in oral fluid and hair. The aim of this study was to describe the excretion profile of ATX and its metabolites 4-hydroxyatomoxetine (4-OH-ATX) and N-desmethylatomoxetine (N-des-ATX) in sweat following the administration of different dosage regimens (60, 40, 35, and 18mg/day) of ATX to six paediatric patients. Sweat patches were applied to the back of each participant and removed at timed intervals. ATX and its metabolites were measured in patches using a previously validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method. Independently from the administered dose, ATX appeared in the sweat patches 1h post administration and reached its maximum concentration generally at 24h. Peak ATX concentrations ranged between 2.31 and 40.4ng/patch and did not correlate with the administered drug dose, or with body surface area. Total ATX excreted in sweat ranged between 0.008 and 0.121mg, corresponding to 0.02 and 0.3{\%} of the administered drug. Neither 4-OH-ATX, nor N-des-ATX was detected in either of the collected sweat patches. Measuring ATX in sweat patches can provide information on cumulative drug use from patch application until removal. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Genomic instability is a key hallmark of cancer that arises owing to defects in the DNA damage response (DDR) and/or increased replication stress. These alterations promote the clonal evolution of cancer cells via the accumulation of driver aberrations, including gene copy-number changes, rearrangements and mutations; however, these same defects also create vulnerabilities that are relatively specific to cancer cells, which could potentially be exploited to increase the therapeutic index of anticancer treatments and thereby improve patient outcomes. The discovery that BRCA-mutant cancer cells are exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase has ushered in a new era of research on biomarker-driven synthetic lethal treatment strategies for different cancers. The therapeutic landscape of antitumour agents targeting the DDR has rapidly expanded to include inhibitors of other key mediators of DNA repair and replication, such as ATM, ATR, CHK1 and CHK2, DNA-PK and WEE1. Efforts to optimize these therapies are ongoing across a range of cancers, involving the development of predictive biomarker assays of responsiveness (beyond BRCA mutations), assessment of the mechanisms underlying intrinsic and acquired resistance, and evaluation of rational, tolerable combinations with standard-of-care treatments (such as chemotherapeutics and radiation), novel molecularly targeted agents and immune-checkpoint inhibitors. In this Review, we discuss the current status of anticancer therapies targeting the DDR.},

abstract = {Cellular levels of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) are meticulously regulated utilizing an array of systems to balance uptake, biosynthesis, catabolism, and efflux transport. Metabolic transformation of all-trans RA to 4-hydroxylated RA appears to be primarily catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 26AI. Analysis of monolayer cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and dermal fibroblasts by quantitative real-time PCR and reverse transcription-PCR revealed no basal levels of CYP26AI mRNA expression, whereas specific transcripts were detectable following addition of 106 M all-trans RA. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed a weak expression of CYP26AI in NHEK, which was increased by stimulation with all-trans RA. Using a newly developed peptide antibody, we further examined the localization of CYP26AI expression in normal skin and three-dimensional (3D) skin models. In contrast to cell culture monolayers where CYP26AI was only weakly detectable, strong constitutive expression of CYP26AI in vivo and in organotypic culture was found to be restricted to basal epidermal keratinocytes, as well as eccrine sweat glands and sebaceous glands. These studies verify the capacity of human skin to metabolize RA, although substantial differences exist in CYP expression between normal skin and 3D skin models compared to monolayer cultures. Complex metabolic processes that maintain retinoid homeostasis may therefore be better studied in model systems more closely resembling in vivo skin. In light of our prior studies documenting the functional activity of RA metabolites, expression of CYP26 in the sebaceous gland epithelium supports the suggestion that altered RA metabolism may be involved in the pathogenesis of acne. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.},

abstract = {Severe oral problems, including oral mucositis (OM) and xerostomia, often occur after conditioning therapy for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Saliva plays a major role in protecting the oral mucosa and teeth. Alterations in salivary flow rate or salivary components resulting in decreased salivary defence mechanisms may affect oral/mucosal health and may influence the severity of OM. A systematic review was conducted to assess the current scientific knowledge on changes in salivary function and composition before and after HSCT. All English or Dutch articles examining salivary flow rate or salivary components before and after HSCT were included after title/abstract selection by 2 independent reviewers (weighted $\kappa$ = .91). After quality assessment and exclusion of all research groups with both children age {\textless}14 years and adults, 33 articles were included for data analysis. Overall, the salivary flow rate was decreased at several days and months after HSCT. Although several salivary components were studied, most components were examined in only 1 or 2 studies with different patient populations or at different time points after HSCT. At 7 days after HSCT, albumin and proinflammatory cytokines were increased, whereas secretory IgA and components of the salivary antioxidant system were decreased. Secretory IgA levels were still reduced at 1 month after HSCT but returned to pre-HSCT values at 6 months after HSCT. Lactoferrin, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, and $\beta$2-microglobulin levels were increased at 6 months after HSCT. Our findings show that changes in saliva reflect an inflammatory response occurring immediately after HSCT, followed by evidence of increased salivary antimicrobial defense mechanisms by 6 months after HSCT.},

abstract = {Significant progress has been made in cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)–programmed death-ligand 1 signaling pathways. Tumors from patients showing sustained treatment response predominately demonstrate a T cell–inflamed tumor microenvironment prior to, or early on, treatment. Not all tumors with this phenotype respond, however, and one mediator of immunosuppression in T cell–inflamed tumors is the tryptophan–kynurenine–aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Trp–Kyn–AhR) pathway. Multiple mechanisms of immunosuppression may be mediated by this pathway including depletion of tryptophan, direct immunosuppression of Kyn, and activity of Kyn-bound AhR. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a principle enzyme in Trp catabolism, is the target of small-molecule inhibitors in clinical development in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. Despite promising results in early-phase clinical trials in a range of tumor types, a phase III study of the IDO1-selective inhibitor epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab showed no difference between the epacadostat-treated group versus placebo in patients with metastatic melanoma. This has led to a diminution of interest in IDO1 inhibitors; however, other approaches to inhibit this pathway continue to be considered. Novel Trp–Kyn–AhR pathway inhibitors, such as Kyn-degrading enzymes, direct AhR antagonists, and tryptophan mimetics are advancing in early-stage or preclinical development. Despite uncertainty surrounding IDO1 inhibition, ample preclinical evidence supports continued development of Trp–Kyn–AhR pathway inhibitors to augment immune-checkpoint and other cancer therapies.},

Whilst sweat gland densities vary widely across the skin surface, this same individual would possess some 2.03 million functional glands, with the highest density on the volar surfaces of the fingers (530 glands.cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and the lowest on the upper lip (16 glands.cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). During passive heating that results in a resting whole-body sweat rate of approximately 0.4 L.min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, the forehead (0.99 mg.cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}), dorsal fingers (0.62 mg.cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and upper back (0.59 mg.cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) would display the highest sweat flows, whilst the medial thighs and anterior legs will secrete the least (both 0.12 mg.cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). Since sweat glands selectively reabsorb electrolytes, the sodium and chloride composition of discharged sweat varies with secretion rate. Across whole-body sweat rates from 0.72 to 3.65 mg.cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, sodium losses of 26.5-49.7 mmol.L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} could be expected, with the corresponding chloride loss being 26.8-36.7 mmol.L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. Nevertheless, there can be threefold differences in electrolyte losses across skin regions. When exercising in the heat, local sweat rates increase dramatically, with regional glandular flows becoming more homogeneous. However, intra-regional evaporative potential remains proportional to each local surface area. Thus, there is little evidence that regional sudomotor variations reflect an hierarchical distribution of sweating either at rest or during exercise. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor and Machado-Moreira; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

However, published literature is scarce and usually covers a limited and non-representative number of donors. We developed a protocol to handle and store ex vivo skin samples post-surgery and prepare skin S9 fractions to measure the metabolic activity of Phase II enzymes. Preincubation of an excess of cofactors at 37 °C for fifteen minutes in the S9 before introduction of the testing probe, greatly increased the stability of the enzymes. Using this standardised assay, the rates of sulphation (SULT) and glucuronidation (UGT) of 7-hydroxycoumarin, methylation (COMT) of dopamine and N-acetylation (NAT) of procainamide were measured in the ng/mg protein/h (converted to ng/cm2/h) range in eighty-seven individuals. Glutathione conjugation (GST) of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was assessed in a smaller pool of fifty donors; the metabolic rate was much faster and measured over six minutes using a different methodology to express rates in $\mu$g/mg protein/min (converted to $\mu$g/cm2/min). A comprehensive statistical analysis of these results was carried out, separating donors by age, gender and metabolic rate measured.},

Based on the recently described anatomical relationship between the scalp hair follicle and the eccrine gland, we have found that scalp follicular unit grafts are an excellent eccrine gland isolation source, especially for the coiled component. In order to make the gland visible for stereoscopic microdissection, the follicular units need to be previously stained with a vital dye like methylene blue or neutral red. The simplicity and efficiency of this isolation method should encourage further research into human eccrine sweat gland function which has always been hindered by the difficulty of gland isolation.},

abstract = {With the effectiveness of therapeutic agents ever decreasing and the increased incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, there is a clear need for administration of more potent, potentially more toxic, drugs. Alternatively, biopharmaceuticals may hold potential but require specialised protection from premature in vivo degradation. Thus, a paralleled need for specialised drug delivery systems has arisen. Although cell-mediated drug delivery is not a completely novel concept, the few applications described to date are not yet ready for in vivo application, for various reasons such as drug-induced carrier cell death, limited control over the site and timing of drug release and/or drug degradation by the host immune system. Here, we present our hypothesis for a new drug delivery system, which aims to negate these limitations. We propose transport of nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs inside autologous macrophages polarised to M1 phenotype for high mobility and treated to induce transient phagosome maturation arrest. In addition, we propose a significant shift of existing paradigms in the study of host-microbe interactions, in order to study microbial host immune evasion and dissemination patterns for their therapeutic utilisation in the context of drug delivery. We describe a system in which microbial strategies may be adopted to facilitate absolute control over drug delivery, and without sacrificing the host carrier cells. We provide a comprehensive summary of the lessons we can learn from microbes in the context of drug delivery and discuss their feasibility for in vivo therapeutic application. We then describe our proposed “synthetic microbe drug delivery system” in detail. In our opinion, this multidisciplinary approach may hold the solution to effective, controlled drug delivery.},

abstract = {Dysregulated human eccrine sweat glands can negatively impact the quality-of-life of people suffering from disorders like hyperhidrosis. Inability of sweating can even result in serious health effects in humans affected by anhidrosis. The underlying mechanisms must be elucidated and a reliable in vitro test system for drug screening must be developed. Here we describe a novel organotypic three-dimensional (3D) sweat gland model made of primary human eccrine sweat gland cells. Initial experiments revealed that eccrine sweat gland cells in a two-dimensional (2D) culture lose typical physiological markers. To resemble the in vivo situation as close as possible, we applied the hanging drop cultivation technology regaining most of the markers when cultured in its natural spherical environment. To compare the organotypic 3D sweat gland model versus human sweat glands in vivo, we compared markers relevant for the eccrine sweat gland using transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Comparing the marker profile, a high in vitro-in vivo correlation was shown. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5), muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3), Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin-1 (ANO1/TMEM16A), and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) are found at significant expression levels in the 3D model. Moreover, cholinergic stimulation with acetylcholine or pilocarpine leads to calcium influx monitored in a calcium flux assay. Cholinergic stimulation cannot be achieved with the sweat gland cell line NCL-SG3 used as a sweat gland model system. Our results show clear benefits of the organotypic 3D sweat gland model versus 2D cultures in terms of the expression of essential eccrine sweat gland key regulators and in the physiological response to stimulation. Taken together, this novel organotypic 3D sweat gland model shows a good in vitro-in vivo correlation and is an appropriate alternative for screening of potential bioactives regulating the sweat mechanism.},

abstract = {Among the unique features of humans, one of the most salient is the ability to effectively cool the body during extreme prolonged activity through the evapotranspiration of water on the skin's surface. The evolution of this novel physiological ability required a dramatic increase in the density and distribution of eccrine sweat glands relative to other mammals and a concomitant reduction of body hair cover. Elucidation of the genetic underpinnings for these adaptive changes is confounded by a lack of knowledge about how eccrine gland fate and density are specified during development. Moreover, although reciprocal changes in hair cover and eccrine gland density are required for efficient thermoregulation, it is unclear if these changes are linked by a common genetic regulation. To identify pathways controlling the relative patterning of eccrine glands and hair follicles, we exploited natural variation in the density of these organs between different strains of mice. Quantitative trait locus mapping identified a large region on mouse Chromosome 1 that controls both hair and eccrine gland densities. Differential and allelic expression analysis of the genes within this interval coupled with subsequent functional studies demonstrated that the level of En1 activity directs the relative numbers of eccrine glands and hair follicles. These findings implicate En1 as a newly identified and reciprocal determinant of hair follicle and eccrine gland density and identify a pathway that could have contributed to the evolution of the unique features of human skin.},

abstract = {The exposure of the skin to medical drugs, skin care products, cosmetics, and other chemicals renders information on xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XME) in the skin highly interesting. Since the use of freshly excised human skin for experimental investigations meets with ethical and practical limitations, information on XME in models comes in the focus including non-human mammalian species and in vitro skin models. This review attempts to summarize the information available in the open scientific literature on XME in the skin of human, rat, mouse, guinea pig, and pig as well as human primary skin cells, human cell lines, and reconstructed human skin models. The most salient outcome is that much more research on cutaneous XME is needed for solid metabolism-dependent efficacy and safety predictions, and the cutaneous metabolism comparisons have to be viewed with caution. Keeping this fully in mind at least with respect to some cutaneous XME, some models may tentatively be considered to approximate reasonable closeness to human skin. For dermal absorption and for skin irritation among many contributing XME, esterase activity is of special importance, which in pig skin, some human cell lines, and reconstructed skin models appears reasonably close to human skin. With respect to genotoxicity and sensitization, activating XME are not yet judgeable, but reactive metabolite-reducing XME in primary human keratinocytes and several reconstructed human skin models appear reasonably close to human skin. For a more detailed delineation and discussion of the severe limitations see the “Overview and Conclusions” section in the end of this review.},

In microarray analysis, the expression of 87{\%} of the genes was consistent between the EpiDerm™ model and human skin indicating the presence of similar metabolic pathways suggesting commonality in function. Analysis of EpiDerm™ models constructed from four donors showed highly comparable expression of xenobiotic metabolizing genes demonstrating reproducibility of the model. Overall, the expression of Phase II enzymes appeared to be more pronounced in human skin and the EpiDerm™ model than that of Phase I enzymes, consistent with the role of skin in detoxification of xenobiotics. Though the basal expression of CYPs in particular was low in EpiDerm™, significant induction of CYP1A1/1B1 activity was observed following treatment with 3-methylcholanthrene. These results indicate that the xenobiotic metabolizing capacity of the EpiDerm™ model appears to be representative of human skin.

These sensors can continuously detect target analytes in skin interstitial fluid (ISF), tears, saliva, and sweat. In this review, we will summarize developments on wearable devices and their potential applications in research, clinical practice, and recreational and sporting activities. Sampling skin ISF can require insertion of a needle into the skin, whereas sweat, tears, and saliva can be sampled by devices worn outside the body. The most widely sampled metabolite from a wearable device is glucose in skin ISF for monitoring diabetes patients. Continuous ISF glucose monitoring allows estimation of the glucose concentration in blood without the pain, inconvenience, and blood waste of fingerstick capillary blood glucose testing. This tool is currently used by diabetes patients to provide information for dosing insulin and determining a diet and exercise plan. Similar technologies for measuring concentrations of other analytes in skin ISF could be used to monitor athletes, emergency responders, warfighters, and others in states of extreme physiological stress. Sweat is a potentially useful substrate for sampling analytes for metabolic monitoring during exercise. Lactate, sodium, potassium, and hydrogen ions can be measured in sweat. Tools for converting the concentrations of these analytes sampled from sweat, tears, and saliva into blood concentrations are being developed. As an understanding of the relationships between the concentrations of analytes in blood and easily sampled body fluid increases, then the benefits of new wearable devices for metabolic monitoring will also increase.},

Metabolomics analysis of sweat promises to improve screening, diagnosis and self-monitoring of numerous conditions through new applications and greater personalisation of medical interventions. Before these applications can be fully developed, existing methods for the collection, handling, processing and storage of human sweat need to be revised. This review presents a cross-disciplinary overview of the origins, composition,physical characteristics and functional roles of human sweat, and explores the factors involved in standardising sweat collection for metabolomics analysis.Methods A literature review of human sweat analysis over the past 10 years (2006-2016) was performed to identify studies with metabolomics or similarly applicable 'omics' analysis. These studies were reviewed with attention to sweat induction and sampling techniques,timing of sweat collection, sweat storage conditions, laboratory derivation, processing and analytical platforms.Results Comparative analysis of 20 studies revealed numerous factors that can significantly impact the validity, reliability and reproducibility of sweat analysis including: anatomical site of sweat sampling, skin integrity and preparation; temperature and humidity at the sweat collection sites; timing and nature of sweat collection; metabolic quenching; transport and storage;qualitative and quantitative measurements of the skin microbiota at sweat collection sites; and individual variables such as diet,emotional state, metabolic conditions, pharmaceutical, recreational drug and supplement use.Conclusion Further development of standard operating protocols for human sweat collection can open the way for sweat metabolomics to significantly add to our understanding of human physiology in health and disease.},

abstract = {Wearable sensor technologies are essential to the realization of personalized medicine through continuously monitoring an individual's state of health. Sampling human sweat, which is rich in physiological information, could enable non-invasive monitoring. Previously reported sweat-based and other non-invasive biosensors either can only monitor a single analyte at a time or lack on-site signal processing circuitry and sensor calibration mechanisms for accurate analysis of the physiological state. Given the complexity of sweat secretion, simultaneous and multiplexed screening of target biomarkers is critical and requires full system integration to ensure the accuracy of measurements. Here we present a mechanically flexible and fully integrated (that is, no external analysis is needed) sensor array for multiplexed in situ perspiration analysis, which simultaneously and selectively measures sweat metabolites (such as glucose and lactate) and electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium ions), as well as the skin temperature (to calibrate the response of the sensors). Our work bridges the technological gap between signal transduction, conditioning (amplification and filtering), processing and wireless transmission in wearable biosensors by merging plastic-based sensors that interface with the skin with silicon integrated circuits consolidated on a flexible circuit board for complex signal processing. This application could not have been realized using either of these technologies alone owing to their respective inherent limitations. The wearable system is used to measure the detailed sweat profile of human subjects engaged in prolonged indoor and outdoor physical activities, and to make a real-time assessment of the physiological state of the subjects. This platform enables a wide range of personalized diagnostic and physiological monitoring applications.},

abstract = {Understanding sex differences in colon cancer is essential to advance disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Males have a higher risk of developing colon cancer and a lower survival rate than women. However, the molecular features that drive these sex differences are poorly understood. In this study, we use both transcript-based and gene regulatory network methods to analyze RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for 445 patients with colon cancer. We compared gene expression between tumors in men and women and observed significant sex differences in sex chromosome genes only. We then inferred patient-specific gene regulatory networks and found significant regulatory differences between males and females, with drug and xenobiotics metabolism via cytochrome P450 pathways more strongly targeted in females. This finding was validated in a dataset of 1,193 patients from five independent studies. While targeting, the drug metabolism pathway did not change overall survival for males treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, females with greater targeting showed an increase in 10-year overall survival probability, 89{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 78-100] survival compared with 61{\%} (95{\%} CI, 45-82) for women with lower targeting, respectively (P ¼ 0.034). Our network analysis uncovers patterns of transcriptional regulation that differentiate male and female colon cancer and identifies differences in regulatory processes involving the drug metabolism pathway associated with survival in women who receive adjuvant chemotherapy. This approach can be used to investigate the molecular features that drive sex differences in other cancers and complex diseases.},

abstract = {Scientific interest in defining the human body's ability to limit the effects of administered drugs and xenobiotics dates from the mid-19th century when developing knowledge and techniques in the field of organic chemistry first made such studies possible. The first experimental evidence documenting the existence of cytochrome p450 (CYP) dates to the year 1955, when an enzyme system capable of oxidizing xenobiotic compounds was identified in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver homogenates. From these days on several studies analyzed the expression and function of metabolizing phase I enzymes in liver cells. Due to the unique structural features of human skin, little was known about the expression and function of CYP enzymes in this tissue and their role in uptake, metabolism and elimination of xenobiotics as well as endogenous substrates. Lasting recent years it has become clear that human skin cells express various CYP enzymes, including CYP26AI which is responsible for the metabolism of retinoic acid in skin cells. It has been also shown that CYP enzyme expression patterns are cell type and tissue specific and that in skin cells this differs significantly from its expression in other environmental interfaces such as the liver, lung and gastrointestinal tract. Therefore knowledge of skin-specific CYP expression and function is a prerequisite for pharmacological studies of the skin.},

To complement the testing of metabolically activated chemicals, such as cyclophosphamide (CPA) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), we measured phase 1 (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) and testosterone metabolism) and 2 activities (UGTs and GSTs) in non-treated and genotoxin treated EpiDerm™ models in a study design which mimics the RSMN assay. The assay involved a three-dose dosing regimen over 72h to take into account effects e.g. enzyme induction, which requires longer than the standard 2 dose 48-h assay. These studies demonstrated the presence of basal phase 1 and 2 activities of EpiDerm™ models. With the exception of GST, all of the activities measured did not reproducibly change over time. It was possible to measure enzyme induction using this assay design. EROD activity was significantly induced by B[a]P but not by CPA. CPA and B[a]P had little or no reproducible effects on GST and UGT activities. In conclusion, a number of metabolic enzyme activities were present in the EpiDerm™ skin model and at least the CYP1 family was inducible. {\textcopyright} 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Human skin has the capacity to metabolise foreign chemicals (xenobiotics), but knowledge of the various enzymes involved is incomplete. A broad-based unbiased proteomics approach was used to describe the profile of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes present in human skin and hence indicate principal routes of metabolism of xenobiotic compounds. Several in vitro models of human skin have been developed for the purpose of safety assessment of chemicals. The suitability of these epidermal models for studies involving biotransformation was assessed by comparing their profiles of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes with those of human skin. Methodology/Principal Findings: Label-free proteomic analysis of whole human skin (10 donors) was applied and analysed using custom-built PROTSIFT software. The results showed the presence of enzymes with a capacity for the metabolism of alcohols through dehydrogenation, aldehydes through dehydrogenation and oxidation, amines through oxidation, carbonyls through reduction, epoxides and carboxylesters through hydrolysis and, of many compounds, by conjugation to glutathione. Whereas protein levels of these enzymes in skin were mostly just 4-10 fold lower than those in liver and sufficient to support metabolism, the levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes were at least 300-fold lower indicating they play no significant role. Four epidermal models of human skin had profiles very similar to one another and these overlapped substantially with that of whole skin. Conclusions/Significance: The proteomics profiling approach was successful in producing a comprehensive analysis of the biotransformation characteristics of whole human skin and various in vitro skin models. The results show that skin contains a range of defined enzymes capable of metabolising different classes of chemicals. The degree of similarity of the profiles of the in vitro models indicates their suitability for epidermal toxicity testing. Overall, these results provide a rational basis for explaining the fate of xenobiotics in skin and will aid chemical safety testing programmes. {\textcopyright} 2012 van Eijl et al.},

abstract = {Background: Eccrine sweat glands (ESGs) are critical for thermoregulation and are involved in wound healing. ESGs have traditionally been considered as separate skin appendages without connection to the pilosebaceous unit (PSU). However, recent preliminary evidence has encouraged the hypothesis that the PSU and ESG are more interconnected than previously thought. Objectives: To re-evaluate the morphology of human skin adnexa with an integrated three-dimensional (3D) perspective in order to explore the possible interconnections that the PSU and the ESG may form. Methods: A systematic 3D reconstruction method of skin sections, direct visualization of human scalp follicular unit transplant grafts and a scalp strip ex vivo were used to validate and further explore the hypothesis. Results: We demonstrate that the coiled portion of most ESGs is morphologically integrated into the PSU of human scalp skin and forms a structural unit that is embedded into a specific, hair follicle-associated region of dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT). This newly recognized unit is easily accessible and experimentally tractable by organ culture of follicular units and can be visualized intravitally. Conclusions: We propose a model of functional human skin anatomy in which ESGs are closely associated with the PSU and the dWAT to form a common homeostatic tissue environment, which may best be encapsulated in the term ‘adnexal skin unit'. The challenge now is to dissect how each component of this superstructure of human skin functionally cooperates with and influences the other under physiological conditions, during regeneration and repair and in selected skin diseases.},

abstract = {Eccrine sweat glands help to maintain homoeostasis, primarily by stabilizing body temperature. Derived from embryonic ectoderm, millions of eccrine glands are distributed across human skin and secrete litres of sweat per day. Their easy accessibility has facilitated the start of analyses of their development and function. Mouse genetic models find sweat gland development regulated sequentially by Wnt, Eda and Shh pathways, although precise subpathways and additional regulators require further elucidation. Mature glands have two secretory cell types, clear and dark cells, whose comparative development and functional interactions remain largely unknown. Clear cells have long been known as the major secretory cells, but recent studies suggest that dark cells are also indispensable for sweat secretion. Dark cell-specific Foxa1 expression was shown to regulate a Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-dependent Best2 anion channel that is the candidate driver for the required ion currents. Overall, it was shown that cholinergic impulses trigger sweat secretion in mature glands through second messengers - for example InsP3 and Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} - and downstream ion channels/transporters in the framework of a Na{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-K{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-Cl{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} cotransporter model. Notably, the microenvironment surrounding secretory cells, including acid-base balance, was implicated to be important for proper sweat secretion, which requires further clarification. Furthermore, multiple ion channels have been shown to be expressed in clear and dark cells, but the degree to which various ion channels function redundantly or indispensably also remains to be determined.},

abstract = {Fibroblast activation is a crucial step in tumor growth and metastatic progression. Activated fibroblasts remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) in primary tumor and metastatic microenvironments, exerting both pro- and antitumorigenic effects. However, the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate the activation of fibroblasts are not well-defined. The signaling axis comprising the calcium-activated Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (CN), and its downstream target nuclear factor of activated T cells, has been implicated in endothelial (EC) and immune cell activation, but its role in fibroblasts is not known. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of CN in fibroblasts in vitro altered fibroblast morphology and function consistent with an activated phenotype relative to wild-type fibroblasts. CN-null fibroblasts had a greater migratory capacity, increased collagen secretion and remodeling, and promoted more robust EC activation in vitro. ECM generated by CN-null fibroblasts contained more collagen with greater alignment of fibrillar collagen compared with wild-type fibroblast-derived matrix. These differences in matrix composition and organization imposed distinct changes in morphology and cytoskeletal architecture of both fibroblasts and tumor cells. Consistent with this in vitro phenotype, mice with stromal CN deletion had a greater incidence and larger lung metastases. Our data suggest that CN signaling contributes to the maintenance of fibroblast homeostasis and that loss of CN is sufficient to promote fibroblast activation. Significance: Calcineurin signaling is a key pathway underlying fibroblast homeostasis that could be targeted to potentially prevent fibroblast activation in distant metastatic sites.},

Ten trained athletes and nine untrained counterparts were passively heated until oral temperature (as estimated by sublingual temperature, Tor) increased by 1.5°C above baseline resting. Forearm sweat rate (ventilated capsule) was measured at three skin sites continuously perfused with either lactated Ringer's solution (Control), 10 mmol/L NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, non-selective NOS inhibitor), or 10 mmol/L ketorolac (Ketorolac, non-selective COX inhibitor) via intradermal microdialysis. Sweat rate was averaged for each 0.3°C increase in Tor. Sweat rate at the L-NAME site was lower than Control following a 0.9 and 1.2°C increase in Tor in both groups (all P ≤ 0.05). Relative to the Control site, NOS-inhibition reduced sweating similarly between the groups (P = 0.51). Sweat rate at the Ketorolac site was not different from the Control at any levels of Tor in both groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Nevertheless, a greater sweat rate was measured at the end of heating in the trained as compared to the untrained individuals (P ≤ 0.05). We show that NOS contributes similarly to sweating in both trained and untrained individuals during a passive heat stress. Further, no effect of COX on sweating was measured for either group. The greater sweat production observed in endurance-trained athletes is likely mediated by factors other than NOS- and COX-dependent mechanisms.},

To successfully disseminate, metastatic cells acquire properties in addition to those necessary to become neoplastic. Heterogeneity in mechanisms involved, routes of dissemination, redundancy of molecular pathways that can be utilized, and the ability to piggyback on the actions of surrounding stromal cells makes defining the hallmarks of metastasis extraordinarily challenging. Nonetheless, this review identifies four distinguishing features that are required: motility and invasion, ability to modulate the secondary site or local microenvironments, plasticity, and ability to colonize secondary tissues. By defining these first principles of metastasis, we provide the means for focusing efforts on the aspects of metastasis that will improve patient outcomes.},

Of 122 records identified, 24 were included in evidence synthesis. Populations, and sweat collection methods and concentrations varied widely. In individuals with higher exposure or body burden, sweat generally exceeded plasma or urine concentrations, and dermal could match or surpass urinary daily excretion. Arsenic dermal excretion was severalfold higher in arsenic-exposed individuals than in unexposed controls. Cadmium was more concentrated in sweat than in blood plasma. Sweat lead was associated with high-molecular-weight molecules, and in an interventional study, levels were higher with endurance compared with intensive exercise. Mercury levels normalized with repeated saunas in a case report. Sweating deserves consideration for toxic element detoxification.

The majority of analytical methods used chromatographic separation prior to MS; however, such a hyphenated methodology greatly limits analytical throughput. On the other hand, the mass spectrometric methods that exclude chromatographic separation are fast but suffer from matrix interferences. To enable development of quantitative assays for unconventional matrices, it is desirable to standardize the protocols for the analysis of each specimen and create appropriate certified reference materials. Overcoming these challenges will make analysis of unconventional human biological matrices more common in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {Sweat is produced by eccrine and apocrine glands and represents a biological fluid with established roles in thermo-regulation and host infection defense. The composition of sweat is highly dynamic and alters significantly in various skin and other disorders. Therefore, in-depth profiling of sweat protein composition is expected to augment our understanding of the pathobiology of several skin diseases and may lead to the identification of useful sweat-based disease biomarkers. We here reported an in-depth analysis of the human sweat proteome and peptidome. Sweat was collected from healthy males and healthy females of ages 20–60 years, following strenuous exercise. Two sweat pools were prepared (1 for males and 1 for females) and were subjected to sample preparation for mass spectrometric analysis. We identified a total of 861 unique proteins during our proteomic analysis and 32,818 endogenous peptides (corresponding to additional 1067 proteins) from our peptidomics workflow. As expected, the human skin was identified as the most abundant source of sweat proteins and peptides. Several skin proteases and protease inhibitors were identified in human sweat, highlighting the intense proteolytic activity of human skin. The presence of several antimicrobial peptides supports the functional roles of sweat in host defense and innate immunity. Significance Sweat is a skin-associated biological fluid, secreted by eccrine and apocrine glands, with essential function in body thermo-regulation and host infection defense. In the present study, we performed in-depth profiling of both sweat proteome and peptidome composition. Our data provide the most in-depth characterization of the skin's catalytic network present in sweat. For the first time, we brought to light novel peptides in human sweat that potentially have antimicrobial activity, which highlight the important role of this fluid in innate immunity. All these findings allow us to have a better understanding of the complex web of proteases in skin and may act as a platform for the future discovery of novel skin biomarkers.},

Plasma protein binding (PPB) should not usually be considered a parameter for optimization, but in the particular case of acidic molecules, raising the PPB above a certain level can result in distribution volume becoming a constant low value equal to the distribution volume of albumin while acting to reduce CL through restricting hepatic and renal access of unbound drug. Thus effective half-life can be increased.

abstract = {The immunosuppressant, SDZ IMM 125 (IMM), is a derivative of cyclosporin A (CyA). The disposition kinetics of IMM in plasma, blood cells, and various tissues of the rat was characterized by a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model; the model was then applied to predict the disposition kinetics in dog and human. Accumulation of IMM in blood cell is high (equilibrium blood cell/plasma ratio=8), although the kinetics of drug transference between plasma and blood cell is moderately slow, taking approximately 10 min to reach equilibrium, implying a membranelimited distribution into blood cells. A local PBPK model, assuming blood-flow limited distribution and tissue/blood partition coefficient (KP) data, failed to adequately describe the observed kinetics of distribution, which were slower than predicted. A membrane transport limitation is therefore needed to model dynamic tissue distribution data. Moreover, a slowly interacting intracellular pool was also necessary to adequately describe the kinetics of distribution in some organs. Three elimination pathways (metabolism, biliary secretion, and glomerular filtration) of IMM were assessed at steady state in vivo and characterized independently by the corresponding clearance terms. A whole-body PBPK model was developed according to these findings, which described closely the IMM concentration-time profiles in arterial blood as well as 14 organs/tissues of the rat after intravenous administration. The model was then scaled up to larger mammals by modifying physiological parameters, tissue distribution and elimination clearances;in vivo enzymatic activity was considered in the scale-up of metabolic clearance. The simulations agreed well with the experimental measurements in dog and human, despite the large interspecies difference in the metabolic clearance, which does not follow the usual allometric relationship. In addition, the nonlinear increase in maximum blood concentration and AUC with increasing dose, observed in healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, was accommodated quantitatively by incorporating the known saturation of specific binding of IMM to blood cells. Overall, the PBPK model provides a promising tool to quantitatively link preclinical and clinical data. {\textcopyright} 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {Background: Clinical trials in children are being encouraged by regulatory authorities in light of the immense off-label and unlicensed use of drugs in the paediatric population. The use of in silico techniques for pharmacokinetic prediction will aid in the development of paediatric clinical trials by guiding dosing regimens, ensuring efficient blood sampling times, maximising therapeutic effect and potentially reducing the number of children required for the study. The goal of this study was to extend an existing physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for adults to reflect the age-related physiological changes in children from birth to 18 years of age and, in conjunction with a previously developed age-specific clearance model, to evaluate the accuracy of the paediatric PBPK model to predict paediatric plasma profiles. Methods: The age-dependence of bodyweight, height, organ weights, blood flows, interstitial space and vascular space were taken from the literature. Physiological parameters that were used in the PBPK model were checked against literature values to ensure consistency. These included cardiac output, portal vein flow, extracellular water, total body water, lipid and protein. Five model compounds (paracetamol [acetaminophen], alfentanil, morphine, theophylline and levofloxacin) were then examined by gathering the plasma concentration-time profiles, volumes of distribution and elimination half-lives from different ages of children and adults. First, the adult data were used to ensure accurate prediction of pharmacokinetic profiles. The model was then scaled to the specific age of children in the study, including the scaling of clearance, and the generated plasma concentration profiles, volumes of distribution and elimination half-lives were compared with literature values. Results: Physiological scaling produced highly age-dependent cardiac output, portal vein flow, extracellular water, total body water, lipid and protein values that well represented literature data. The pharmacokinetic profiles in children for the five compounds were well predicted and the trends associated with age were evident. Thus, young neonates had plasma concentrations greater than the adults and older children had concentrations less than the adults. Eighty-three percent, 97{\%} and 87{\%} of the predicted plasma concentrations, volumes of distribution and elimination half-lives, respectively, were within 50{\%} of the study reported values. There was no age-dependent bias for term neonates to 18 years of age when examining volumes of distribution and elimination half-lives. Conclusion: This study suggests that the developed paediatric PBPK model can be used to scale pharmacokinetics from adults. The accurate prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters in children will aid in the development of dosing regimens and sampling times, thus increasing the efficiency of paediatric clinical trials. {\textcopyright} 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

abstract = {In clinical development stages, an a priori assessment of the sensitivity of the pharmacokinetic behavior with respect to physiological and anthropometric properties of human (sub-) populations is desirable. A physiology-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) population model was developed that makes use of known distributions of physiological and anthropometric properties obtained from the literature for realistic populations. As input parameters, the simulation model requires race, gender, age, and two parameters out of body weight, height and body mass index. From this data, the parameters relevant for PBPK modeling such as organ volumes and blood flows are determined for each virtual individual. The resulting parameters were compared to those derived using a previously published model (P3M). Mean organ weights and blood flows were highly correlated between the two models, despite the different methods used to generate these parameters. The inter-individual variability differed greatly especially for organs with a log-normal weight distribution (such as fat and spleen). Two exemplary population pharmacokinetic simulations using ciprofloxacin and paclitaxel as model drugs showed good correlation to observed variability. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the physiological differences in the virtual individuals and intrinsic clearance variability were equally influential to the pharmacokinetic variability but were not additive. In conclusion, the new population model is well suited to assess the influence of individual physiological variability on the pharmacokinetics of drugs. It is expected that this new tool can be beneficially applied in the planning of clinical studies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Although this phenomenon can often be explained by reduced target-expressing cells, other mechanisms may play a role. We use a novel minimal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model to evaluate an alternative drug–disease interaction mechanism involving competitive inhibition of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated Immunoglobulin G recycling by paraproteins. The model is validated with clinical data from the anti-FcRn antibody M281 and is used to conduct a scenario test to quantify the interaction among M-protein, the characteristic paraprotein of multiple myeloma (MM), and the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab indicated for MM treatment. Simulations predict up to a 3.6-fold increase in daratumumab half-life following M-protein reduction, which lends credence to the hypothesis that FcRn competition in MM can manifest as time-dependent reduction of clearance for daratumumab. This model can inform optimal dosing strategies for antibodies in MM and other pathologies of paraprotein excess.},

abstract = {The identification of nonopioid alternatives to treat chronic pain has received a great deal of interest in recent years. Recently, the engineering of a series of Nav1.7 inhibitory peptide-antibody conjugates has been reported, and herein, the preclinical efforts to identify novel approaches to characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of the peptide conjugates are described. A cryopreserved plated mouse hepatocyte assay was designed to measure the depletion of the peptide-antibody conjugates from the media, with a correlation being observed between percentage remaining in the media and in vivo clearance (Pearson r = 20.5525). Physicochemical (charge and hydrophobicity), receptor-binding [neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)], and in vivo pharmacokinetic data were generated and compared with the results from our in vitro hepatocyte assay, which was hypothesized to encompass all of the aforementioned properties. Correlations were observed among hydrophobicity; FcRn binding; depletion rates from the hepatocyte assay; and ultimately, in vivo clearance. Subsequent studies identified potential roles for the lowdensity lipoprotein and mannose/galactose receptors in the association of the Nav1.7 peptide conjugates with mouse hepatocytes, although in vivo studies suggested that FcRn was still the primary receptor involved in determining the pharmacokinetics of the peptide conjugates. Ultimately, the use of the cryopreserved hepatocyte assay along with FcRn binding and hydrophobic interaction chromatography provided an efficient and integrated approach to rapidly triage molecules for advancement while reducing the number of in vivo pharmacokinetic studies.},

abstract = {The importance of the vascular supply for bone is well-known to orthopaedists but is still rather overlooked within the wider field of skeletal research. Blood supplies oxygen, nutrients and regulatory factors to tissues, as well as removing metabolic waste products such as carbon dioxide and acid. Bone receives up to about 10{\%} of cardiac output, and this blood supply permits a much higher degree of cellularity, remodelling and repair than is possible in cartilage, which is avascular. The blood supply to bone is delivered to the endosteal cavity by nutrient arteries, then flows through marrow sinusoids before exiting via numerous small vessels that ramify through the cortex. The marrow cavity affords a range of vascular niches that are thought to regulate the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic and stromal cells, in part via gradients of oxygen tension. The quality of vascular supply to bone tends to decline with age and may be compromised in common pathological settings, including diabetes, anaemias, chronic airway diseases and immobility, as well as by tumours. Reductions in vascular supply are associated with bone loss. This may be due in part to the direct effects of hypoxia, which blocks osteoblast function and bone formation but causes reciprocal increases in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Common regulatory factors such as parathyroid hormone or nitrates, both of which are potent vasodilators, might exert their osteogenic effects on bone via the vasculature. These observations suggest that the bone vasculature will be a fruitful area for future research.},

This new vision will be reliant on the measurement in vitro, of concentration-dependent responses where prolonged excessive perturbations of specific biochemical pathways are likely to lead to adverse health effects in an intact organism. Such an approach requires a framework, into which disparate data generated using in vitro, in silico and in chemico systems, can be integrated and utilised for quantitative in vitro-to-. in vivo extrapolation (QIVIVE), ultimately to the human population level. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are ideally suited for this and are obligatory in order to translate in vitro concentration-response relationships to an exposure or dose, route and duration regime in people. In this report we describe PopGen a virtual human population generator which is a user friendly, open access web-based application for the prediction of realistic anatomical, physiological and phase 1 metabolic variation in a wide range of healthy human populations. We demonstrate how PopGen can be used for QIVIVE by providing input to a PBPK model, at an appropriate level of detail, to reconstruct exposure from human biomonitoring data. We discuss how the process of exposure reconstruction from blood biomarkers, in general, is analogous to exposure or dose reconstruction from concentration-response measurements made in proposed in vitro cell based systems which are assumed to be surrogates for target organs.},

However, subcutaneous injections are typically limited to 1 mL due to concerns of injection pain from volume, viscosity, and formulation characteristics. Back pressure can serve as an indicator for changes in subcutaneous mechanical properties leading to pain during injection. The purpose of this study was to investigate subcutaneous pressures and injection site reactions as a function of injection volume and flow rate. A pressure sensor in the fluid path recorded subcutaneous pressures in the abdomen of Yorkshire swine. The subcutaneous tissue accommodates large-volume injections and with little back pressure as long as low flow rates are used. A 1 mL injection in 10 seconds (360 mL/h flow rate) generated a pressure of 24.0 ± 3.4 kPa, whereas 10 mL delivered in 10 minutes (60 mL/h flow rate) generated a pressure of 7.4 ± 7.8 kPa. After the injection, the pressure decays to 0 over several seconds. The subcutaneous pressures and mechanical strain increased with increasing flow rate but not increasing dose volume. These data are useful for the design of injection devices to mitigate back pressure and pain during subcutaneous large-volume injection.},

abstract = {Background: The new technique of sentinel lymphadenectomy for cutaneous melanoma provided us with a unique opportunity to quantitate the rates of lymphatic flow in afferent lymphatics. Methods: Seventeen melanoma patients underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with technetium 99m-human serum albumin (HSA). The time and distance between the injection site and the sentinel lymph node (LN) were recorded. By comparison, lymphatic flow rates between footpad, popliteal LN, femoral LN, and systemic blood were measured in 60 female mice (C57BL/6) after footpad injection of 99mTc-HSA. Results: The rate of lymphatic flow to 14 axillary, four inguinal, one popliteal, and one parotid sentinel LNs averaged 10.4 ± 7.3 cm/min. In contrast, the lymphatic flow rate between the footpad and the popliteal LN in mice (analogous to the sentinel LN in human beings) averaged 1.33 ± 0.52 cm/min. There was a marked delay in the passage of radionuclide through the popliteal LN with consequent slowing of the rate of flow between the popliteal and femoral LNs to 0.22 cm/min. Conclusion: Lymphatic flow to the sentinel LN occurs rapidly from both human skin and murine footpads. This information might be helpful in planning the timing of the incision after vital blue dye injection for identifying the sentinel LN. {\textcopyright} 1996 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.},

A dimer of FcRn heterodimers observed in the co-crystals and in the crystals of FcRn alone2 could be involved in binding Fc, correlating with the 2:1 binding stoichiometry between FcRn and IgG (ref. 4) and suggesting an unusual orientation of FcRn on the membrane. {\textcopyright} 2002 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Fc receptors expressed in the gut of newborn rodents bind to maternal immunoglobulin in milk at pH 6.5, and transport it to the bloodstream of the neonate, where it dissociates at pH 7.4. The rat intestinal Fc receptor (FcRn) consists of a heavy chain, with significant sequence similarity to the heavy chain of class I MHC molecules, complexed to the class I light chain, $\beta$2-microglobulin. Although FcRn is predicted to contain a groove analogous to that which serves as the MHC peptide-binding site, the immunoglobulin ligand of FcRn is a macromolecule instead of a peptide. We have expressed and crystallized a secreted form of FcRn, and here report the crystallization of a complex between FcRn and its Fc ligand. Isolated FcRn-Fc complexes crystallize in space group I222 or I212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 125 {\AA}, b = 152 {\AA} and c = 216 {\AA}. The crystals diffract to 5.5 {\AA} resolution with anisotropic diffraction to 3.5 {\AA}. Data collection from cryopreserved crystals may allow the resolution limit to be extended, since the major reason for the poor resolution appears to be radiation decay. Even a low-resolution view of how FcRn binds Fc would be of interest to see if the binding site corresponds to the functional part of an MHC molecule. Since the structure of Fc is known, and a structure determination of FcRn is underway, it may be possible to locate the Fc binding site on FcRn at low resolution. As an initial characterization of the FcRn-Fc mode of interaction, and to facilitate the structure determination, we have determined the stoichiometry of binding of FcRn to Fc. We show that two FcRn molecules bind per Fc, as determined by analysis of gels of washed stals, a column binding assay, and isothermal titration calorimetry. {\textcopyright} Academic Press Limited. {\textcopyright} Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are widely used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and autoimmune diseases. Although the mechanism of action in vivo is not always known, the therapeutic activity of several approved mAbs depends on the binding of the Fc$\gamma$ regions to low-affinity Fc$\gamma$ receptors (Fc$\gamma$R) expressed on effector cells. We did functional genetic screens to identify IgG1 Fc domains with improved binding to the low-affinity activating Fc receptor CD16A (Fc$\gamma$RIIIA) and reduced binding to the low-affinity inhibitory Fc receptor, CD32B (Fc$\gamma$RIIB). Identification of new amino acid residues important for Fc$\gamma$R binding guided the construction of an Fc domain that showed a dramatically enhanced CD16A binding and greater than a 100-fold improvement in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In a xenograft murine model of B-cell malignancy, the greatest enhancement of an Fc-optimized anti-human B-cell mAb was accounted for by improved binding to Fc$\gamma$RIV, a unique mouse activating Fc$\gamma$R that is expressed by monocytes and macrophages but not natural killer (NK) cells, consistent with experimental and clinical data suggesting that mononuclear phagocytes, effector cells expressing both activating and inhibitory Fc$\gamma$R, are critical mediators of B-cell depletion in vivo. By using mice transgenic for human CD16A, enhanced survival was observed due to expression of CD16A-158phe on monocytes and macrophages as well as on NK cells in these mice. The design of new generations of improved antibodies for immunotherapy should aim at Fc optimization to increase the engagement of activating Fc$\gamma$R present on the surface of tumor-infiltrating effector cell populations. {\textcopyright}2007 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {The binding and subsequent intracellular processing of transferrin and transferrin receptors was studied in A431 cells using 125I-transferrin and a monoclonal antibody to the receptor (ATR) labeled with 125I and gold colloid. Using 125I-transferrin we have shown that, whereas at 37°C uptake proceeded linearly for up to 60 min, most of the ligand that was bound was internalized and then rapidly returned to the incubation medium undegraded. At 37°C, the intracellular half-life of the most rapidly recycled transferrin was 7.5 min. 125I-ATR displayed the same kinetics of uptake but following its internalization at 37°C, it was partially degraded. At 22°C and below, the intracellular degradation of 125I-ATR was selectively inhibited and as a result it accumulated intracellularly. Electron microscopy of conventional thin sections and of whole-cell mounts was used to follow the uptake and processing of transferrin receptors labeled with ATR-gold colloid complexes. Using a pulse-chase protocol, the intracellular pathway followed by internalized ATR gold-receptor complexes was outlined in detail. Within 5 min at 22°C the internalized complexes were transferred from coated pits on the cell surface to a system of narrow, branching cisternae within the peripheral cytoplasm. By 15 min, they reached larger, more dilated elements that, in thin section, appeared as irregular profiles containing small (30-50-nm diam) vesicles. By 30 min, the gold complexes were located predominantly within typical spherical multivesicular bodies lying in the peripheral cytoplasm, and by 40-60 min, they reached a system of cisternal and multivesicular body elements in the juxtanuclear area. At 22°C, no other compartments became labeled but if they were warmed to 37° C the gold complexes were transferred to lysosome-like elements. Extracting ATR-gold complexes with Triton X after a 30-min chase at 22°C and purifying them on Sephadex-transferrin indicated that the internalized complexes remained bound to the transferrin receptor during their intracellular processing.},

abstract = {Antibodies are essential components of an adaptive immune response. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most common type of antibody found in circulation and extracellular fluids. Although IgG alone can directly protect the body from infection through the activities of its antigen binding region, the majority of IgG immune functions are mediated via proteins and receptors expressed by specialized cell subsets that bind to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of IgG. Fc gamma ($\gamma$) receptors (Fc$\gamma$R) belong to a broad family of proteins that presently include classical membrane-bound surface receptors as well as atypical intracellular receptors and cytoplasmic glycoproteins. Among the atypical Fc$\gamma$Rs, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has increasingly gained notoriety given its intimate influence on IgG biology and its ability to also bind to albumin. FcRn functions as a recycling or transcytosis receptor that is responsible for maintaining IgG and albumin in the circulation, and bidirectionally transporting these two ligands across polarized cellular barriers. More recently, it has been appreciated that FcRn acts as an immune receptor by interacting with and facilitating antigen presentation of peptides derived from IgG immune complexes (IC). Here we review FcRn biology and focus on newer advances including how emerging FcRn-targeted therapies may affect the immune responses to IgG and IgG IC. 2019 Pyzik, Sand, Hubbard, Andersen, Sandlie and Blumberg.},

abstract = {Several CD4 mAbs have entered the clinic for the treatment of autoimmune diseases or transplant rejection. Most of these mAbs caused CD4 cell depletion, and some were murine mAbs which were further hampered by human anti-mouse Ab responses. To obviate these concerns, a primatized CD4 mAb, clenoliximab, was generated by fusing the V domains of a cynomolgus macaque mAb to human constant regions. The heavy chain constant region is a modified IgG4 containing two single residue substitutions designed to ablate residual Fc receptor binding activity and to stabilize heavy chain dimer formation. This study compares and contrasts the in vitro properties of clenoliximab with its matched IgG1 derivative, keliximab, which shares the same variable regions. Both mAbs show potent inhibition of in vitro T cell responses, lack of binding to complement component C1q, and inability to mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity. However, clenoliximab shows markedly reduced binding to Fc receptors and therefore does not mediate Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or modulation/loss of CD4 from the surface of T cells, except in the presence of rheumatoid factor or activated monocytes. Thus, clenoliximab retains the key immunomodulatory attributes of keliximab without the liability of strong Fcgamma receptor binding. In initial clinical trials, these properties have translated to a reduced incidence of CD4+ T cell depletion.},

abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have complex pharmacology; pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics depend on mAb structure and target antigen. mAbs targeting soluble antigens often exhibit linear pharmacokinetic behavior, whereas mAbs targeting cell surface antigens frequently exhibit nonlinear behavior due to receptor-mediated clearance. Where nonlinear kinetics exist, clearance can change due to receptor loss following repeated dosing andor disease severity. mAb pharmacodynamics are often indirect, with delayed clinically relevant outcomes. This behavior provides challenges during clinical development; studies must be carefully planned to account for complexities specific to each agent.Selection of a starting dose for human studies can be difficult. Species differences in pharmacology need to be considered. Various metrics are available for scaling from animals to humans. Optimal dose selection should ensure uniform mAb exposure across all individuals. Traditional approaches such as flat dosing and variable dosing based upon body surface area or weight should be supported by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior, including target antigen and concurrent disease states. The use of loading doses or dose adjustments to improve clinical response is also a consideration.The evaluation of drug interactions requires innovative designs. Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of mAbs, interacting drugs may need to be administered for protracted periods. Consequently, population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model-based approaches are often implemented to evaluate mAb drug interactions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Adis Data Information BV.},

abstract = {Today, monoclonal immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) antibodies have become a major option in cancer therapy especially for the patients with advanced or metastatic cancers. Efficacy of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is achieved through both its antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and crystallizable fragment (Fc). Fab can specifically recognize tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and thus modulate TAA-linked downstream signaling pathways that may lead to the inhibition of tumor growth, induction of tumor apoptosis,and differentiation. The Fc region can further improve mAbs' efficacy by mediating effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis. Moreover, Fc is the region interacting with the neonatal Fc receptor in a pH-dependent manner that can slow down IgG's degradation and extend its serum half-life. Loss of the antibody Fc region dramatically shortens its serum half-life and weakens its anticancer effects. Given the essential roles that the Fc region plays in the modulation of the efficacy of mAb in cancer treatment, Fc engineering has been extensively studied in the past years. This review focuses on the recent advances in therapeutic Fc engineering that modulates its related effector functions and serum half-life. We also discuss the progress made in aglycosylated mAb development that may substantially reduce the cost of manufacture but maintain similar efficacies as conventional glycosylated mAb. Finally, we highlight several Fc engineering-based mAbs under clinical trials.},

abstract = {In this manuscript, we have presented the development of a novel platform physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to characterize brain disposition of mAbs in the mouse, rat, monkey and human. The model accounts for known anatomy and physiology of the brain, including the presence of distinct blood–brain barrier and blood–cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. CSF and interstitial fluid turnover, and FcRn mediated transport of mAbs are accounted for. The model was first used to characterize published and in-house pharmacokinetic (PK) data on the disposition of mAbs in rat brain, including the data on PK of mAb in different regions of brain determined using microdialysis. Majority of model parameters were fixed based on literature reported values, and only 3 parameters were estimated using rat data. The rat PBPK model was translated to mouse, monkey, and human, simply by changing the values of physiological parameters corresponding to each species. The translated PBPK models were validated by a priori predicting brain PK of mAbs in all three species, and comparing predicted exposures with observed data. The platform PBPK model was able to a priori predict all the validation PK profiles reasonably well (within threefold), without estimating any parameters. As such, the platform PBPK model presented here provides an unprecedented quantitative tool for prediction of mAb PK at the site-of-action in the brain, and preclinical-to-clinical translation of mAbs being developed against central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The proposed model can be further expanded to account for target engagement, disease pathophysiology, and novel mechanisms, to support discovery and development of novel CNS targeting mAbs.},

abstract = {The U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA) has approved several polyclonal antibody preparations and at least 18 monoclonal antibody preparations (antibodies, antibody fragments, antibody fusion proteins, etc.). These drugs, which may be considered as a diverse group of therapeutic proteins, are associated with several interesting pharmacokinetic characteristics. Saturable binding with target antigen may influence antibody disposition, potentially leading to nonlinear distribution and elimination. Independent of antigen interaction, concentration-dependent elimination may be expected for IgG antibodies, due to the influence of the Brambell receptor, FcRn, which protects IgG from catabolism. Antibody administration may induce the development of an endogenous antibody response, which may alter the pharmacokinetics of the therapeutic antibody. Additionally, the pharmacodynamics of antibodies are also complex; these drugs may be used for a wide array of therapeutic applications, and effects may be achieved by a variety of mechanisms.

abstract = {Protein therapeutics represent a diverse array of biologics including antibodies, fusion proteins, and therapeutic replacement enzymes. Since their inception, they have revolutionized the treatment of a wide range of diseases including respiratory, vascular, autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious, and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer. While in vivo pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy studies are routinely carried out for protein therapeutics, studies that identify key factors governing their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties have not been fully investigated. Thorough characterization and in-depth study of their ADME properties are critical in order to support drug discovery and development processes for the production of safer and more effective biotherapeutics. In this review, we discuss the main factors affecting the ADME characteristics of these large macromolecular therapies. We also give an overview of the current tools, technologies, and approaches available to investigate key factors that influence the ADME of recombinant biotherapeutic drugs, and demonstrate how ADME studies will facilitate their future development.},

abstract = {Ginseng (Panax ginseng, C.A. Meyer) has been a popular herbal remedy used in eastern Asian cultures for thousands of years. In North America, the ginseng species indigenous to both Canada and the United States (Panax quinquefolium) represents an important industry for both domestic and export markets. There are numerous theories and claims describing the efficacy of ginseng, which can combat stress, enhance both the central and immune systems and contribute towards maintaining optimal oxidative status against certain chronic disease states and aging. Risk issues concerning the safety of ginseng at recommended dosages are less prominent and scientifically based. While some epidemiological or clinical studies have reported indications of efficacy for specific health benefits or potential toxicity, there are an equal number of studies that provide contradictory evidence. This situation has led to questionable conclusions concerning specific health benefits or risks associated with ginseng. Recent advances in the development of standardized extracts for both Panax ginseng (G-115) and Panax quinquefolius (CNT-2000) have and will continue to assist in the assessment of efficacy and safety standards for ginseng products. This paper reviews the scientific literature and evidence for ginseng efficacy and safety derived mostly from in vitro and animal studies and places emphasis on the need for more randomized, double-blinded, placebo clinical studies that can provide unequivocal conclusions. An example of the efficacy and safety of ginseng is provided with the description of biological activity of a North American ginseng extract (NAGE), which includes illustrating mechanisms for antioxidant activity without prooxidant properties.},

abstract = {The nutritional benefits of fish consumption relate to the utilization of proteins of high biological value, as well as certain minerals and vitamins that fish provide. Fish or fish oil contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that appear to play several useful roles for human health. Conversely, some carcinogenic contaminants are also stored in the adipose tissue of fish. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential health benefits and risks related to the consumption of fish or fish oil. Health benefits related to the consumption of fish or omega-3 PUFAs were obtained by an extensive literature search. Potential health risks related to carcinogenic contaminants (e.g., dioxin, PCB, etc.) in fish were estimated using the U.S. EPA-approved cancer risk assessment guidelines. Potential health risk estimates were evaluated by comparing them with the acceptable excess risk level of 10-6-10-4. Scientific data indicate that the consumption of fish or fish oil containing omega-3 PUFAs reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, decreases mild hypertension, and prevents certain cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Risk estimates in humans for carcinogenic environmental contaminants in fish ranged from an excess risk level of 3×10 -6-9×10-4. These risk estimates appeared to meet the acceptable excess risk level criteria. Therefore, consumption of fish in accordance with the State of Michigan Fish Advisory Guidelines is safe and should be encouraged. The top 11 fish species [e.g., sardines, mackerel, herring (Atlantic and Pacific), lake trout, salmon (Chinook, Atlantic, and Sockeye), anchovy (European), sablefish, and bluefish] provide an adequate amount of omega-3 PUFAs (2.7-7.5g/meal) and appear to meet the nutritional recommendation of the American Heart Association. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Antibody pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are often governed by biological processes such as binding to antigens and other cognate receptors. Emphasis must also be placed, however, on fundamental physicochemical properties that define antibodies as complex macromolecules, including shape, size, hydrophobicity, and charge. Electrostatic interactions between anionic cell membranes and the predominantly positive surface charge of most antibodies can influence blood concentration and tissue disposition kinetics in a manner that is independent of antigen recognition. In this context, the deliberate modification of antibodies by chemical means has been exploited as a valuable preclinical research tool to investigate the relationship between net molecular charge and biological disposition. Findings from these exploratory investigations may be summarized as follows: (I) shifts in isoelectric point of approximately one pI unit or more can produce measurable changes in tissue distribution and kinetics, (II) increases in net positive charge generally result in increased tissue retention and increased blood clearance, and (III) decreases in net positive charge generally result in decreased tissue retention and increased whole body clearance. Understanding electrostatic interactions between antibodies and biological matrices holds relevance in biotechnology, especially with regard to the development of immunoconjugates. The guiding principles and knowledge gained from preclinical evaluation of chemically modified antibodies will be discussed and placed in the context of therapeutic antibodies that are currently marketed or under development, with a particular emphasis on pharmacokinetic and disposition properties.},

The main biological factors that control extravasation of a solute include regional differences in the capillary structures, the disease state of the organ or tissue, and the rate of blood and lymph supply. Physicochemical properties that are of profound significance in the extravasation of macromolecules are molecular size, shape, charge and hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) characteristics. Extravasation of small drugs, proteins, oligonucleotides and genes can be controlled by conjugating or forming complexes with macromolecular carriers. This requires a thorough understanding of the relationship between the chemical structures, physicochemical properties and the pharmacokinetics of both carrier and active molecules. This review article discusses the extravasation of macromolecules from the view points of pharmacokinetics and drug delivery systems, with the main emphasis on the extravasation across the liver, kidney and tumor capillaries.},

abstract = {Antibody charge variants have gained considerable attention in the biotechnology  industry due to their potential influence on stability and biological activity. Subtle differences in the relative proportions of charge variants are often observed during routine biomanufacture or process changes and pose a challenge to demonstrating product comparability. To gain further insights into the impact on biological activity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of monoclonal antibody (mAb) charge heterogeneity, we isolated the major charge forms of a recombinant humanized IgG1 and compared their in vitro properties and in vivo PK. The mAb starting material had a pI range of 8.7-9.1 and was composed of about 20{\%} acidic variants, 12{\%} basic variants, and 68{\%} main peak. Cation exchange displacement chromatography was used to isolate the acidic, basic, and main peak fractions for animal studies. Detailed analyses were performed on the isolated fractions to identify specific chemical modification contributing to the charge differences, and were also characterized for purity and in vitro potency prior to being administered either subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) in rats. All isolated materials had similar potency and rat FcRn binding relative to the starting material. Following IV or SC administration (10 mg/kg) in rats, no difference in serum PK was observed, indicating that physiochemical modifications and pI differences among charge variants were not sufficient to result in PK changes. Thus, these results provided meaningful information for the comparative evaluation of charge-related heterogeneity of mAbs, and suggested that charge variants of IgGs do not affect the in vitro potency, FcRn binding affinity, or the PK properties in rats.},

abstract = {Fc engineering to increase the binding affinity of IgG antibodies to FcRn has been reported to reduce the elimination of IgG antibodies. Herein, we present a novel non-FcRn-dependent approach to reduce the elimination of IgG antibodies. Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in normal mice of various humanized IgG4 antibodies, which had identical constant regions but different variable region sequences, revealed that an antibody with a lower isoelectric point (pI) has a longer half-life. These antibodies exhibited comparable binding affinity to FcRn, and with the antibodies with lower pIs, a longer half-life was also observed in beta2-microglobulin knockout mice, suggesting that differences in the pharmacokinetics were due to a non-FcRn-dependent mechanism. On the basis of our findings, we attempted to engineer the pharmacokinetic properties of a humanized anti-IL6 receptor IgG1 antibody. Selected substitutions in the variable region, without substitution in the Fc region, lowered the pI but did not reduce the biological activity and showed a significant reduction in the clearance of the antibody in cynomolgus monkey. These results suggest that lowering the pI by engineering the variable region could reduce the elimination of IgG antibodies and could provide an alternative to Fc engineering of IgG antibodies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the bioavailability and bioactivity of subcutaneously injected insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized block design with six male mongrel dogs as subjects. In protocol 1, purified pork insulin was infused intravenously to simulate the pattern of appearance in the blood that would have been expected from subcutaneous injection. Three intravenous doses (0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 U/kg) were infused on separate days in a pattern (0-300 min) designed to approximately simulate the absorption rate of subcutaneously injected insulin. In protocol 2, interscapular subcutaneous injections of pork insulin at 0.10 U/kg were made. RESULTS: Integrated insulin, decrement in plasma glucose, and maximal glucose clearance for subcutaneous injection experiments were similar to intravenous infusion of equal dose (P greater than 0.10) but significantly different from low-dose infusions (P less than 0.025). Similar results were observed for hepatic glucose output and glucose uptake. Hypoglycemia elicited counterregulatory responses that appeared to be under a threshold differentiated at a plasma glucose of approximately 3 mM. Integrated insulin was plotted against insulin dose to create dose-response curves for intravenous data. The curve was then used to predict the actual appearance rate of insulin in plasma for subcutaneous injection. The estimated bioavailability of subcutaneous insulin was 103.0 +/- 10.5{\%} of the injected dose. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that, in dogs, insulin delivered subcutaneously in the interscapular area is not significantly degraded before absorption, resulting in metabolic effects equal to intravenous insulin infusion of equivalent dose.},

abstract = {Implementation of in vitro assays that correlate with in vivo human pharmacokinetics (PK) would provide desirable preclinical tools for the early selection of therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidates with minimal non-target-related PK risk. Use of these tools minimizes the likelihood that mAbs with unfavorable PK would be advanced into costly preclinical and clinical development. In total, 42 mAbs varying in isotype and soluble versus membrane targets were tested in in vitro and in vivo studies. MAb physicochemical properties were assessed by measuring non-specific interactions (DNA- and insulin-binding ELISA), self-association (affinity-capture self-interaction nanoparticle spectroscopy) and binding to matrix-immobilized human FcRn (surface plasmon resonance and column chromatography). The range of scores obtained from each in vitro assay trended well with in vivo clearance (CL) using both human FcRn transgenic (Tg32) mouse allometrically projected human CL and observed human CL, where mAbs with high in vitro scores resulted in rapid CL in vivo. Establishing a threshold value for mAb CL in human of 0.32 mL/hr/kg enabled refinement of thresholds for each in vitro assay parameter, and using a combinatorial triage approach enabled the successful differentiation of mAbs at high risk for rapid CL (unfavorable PK) from those with low risk (favorable PK), which allowed mAbs requiring further characterization to be identified. Correlating in vitro parameters with in vivo human CL resulted in a set of in vitro tools for use in early testing that would enable selection of mAbs with the greatest likelihood of success in the clinic, allowing costly late-stage failures related to an inadequate exposure profile, toxicity or lack of efficacy to be avoided.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalization in infants under 1 year of age and there is currently no market-approved vaccine available. For protection against infection, young children mainly depend on their innate immune system and maternal antibodies. Traditionally, antibody-mediated protection against viral infections is thought to be mediated by direct binding of antibodies to viral particles, resulting in virus neutralization. However, in the case of RSV, virus neutralization titers do not provide an adequate correlate of protection. The current lack of understanding of the mechanisms by which antibodies can protect against RSV infection and disease or, alternatively, contribute to disease severity, hampers the design of safe and effective vaccines against this virus. Importantly, neutralization is only one of many mechanisms by which antibodies can interfere with viral infection. Antibodies consist of two structural regions: a variable fragment (Fab) that mediates antigen binding and a constant fragment (Fc) that mediates downstream effector functions via its interaction with Fc-receptors on (innate) immune cells or with C1q, the recognition molecule of the complement system. The interaction with Fc-receptors can lead to killing of virus-infected cells through a variety of immune effector mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Antibody-mediated complement activation may lead to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In addition, both Fc-receptor interactions and complement activation can exert a broad range of immunomodulatory functions. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of Fc-mediated antibody effector functions in both protection and pathogenesis for various infectious agents. In this review article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on Fc-mediated antibody effector functions in the context of RSV infection, discuss their potential role in establishing the balance between protection and pathogenesis, and point out important gaps in our understanding of these processes. Furthermore, we elaborate on the regulation of these effector functions on both the cellular and humoral side. Finally, we discuss the implications of Fc-mediated antibody effector functions for the rational design of safe and effective vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies against RSV.},

Their highly specific targeting of antigens can provide very effective medical treatment, and the advent of molecular-targeting medicine is allowing development of a new generation of therapeutic agents. However, there is one critical obstacle to overcome. Most of the established therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have specificity for the primary structures of target antigens, although all proteins harbor original native intact structures for their own specific functions.

abstract = {A growing number of population pharmacokinetic analyses of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been published in the scientific literature. The aims of this article are to summarize the findings from these studies and to relate the findings to the general pharmacokinetic and structural characteristics of therapeutic mAbs. A two-compartment model was used in the majority of the population analyses to describe the disposition of the mAb. Population estimates of the volumes of distribution in the central (V1) and peripheral (V2) compartments were typically small, with median (range) values of 3.1 (2.45.5) L and 2.8 (1.36.8) L, respectively. The estimated between-subject variability in the V1 was usually moderate, with a median (range) coefficient of variation (CV) of 26 (1284). Between-subject variability in other distribution-related parameters such as the V2 and intercompartmental clearance were often not estimated. Although the pharmacokinetic models used most frequently in the population analyses were models with linear clearance, other models with nonlinear, or parallel linear and nonlinear clearance pathways were also applied, as many therapeutic mAbs are eliminated via saturable target-mediated mechanisms. Population estimates of the maximum elimination rate (Vmax) and the mAb concentration at which elimination was at half maximum for Michaelis-Menten-type elimination pathways varied considerably among the different therapeutic mAbs. However, estimates of the total clearance (CL) of mAbs with linear clearance characteristics and of the clearance of mAbs via the linear clearance pathway (CLL) with parallel linear and nonlinear clearance were quite similar for the different mAbs and typically ranged from 0.2 to 0.5Lday, which is relatively close to the estimated clearance of endogenous IgG of 0.21Lday. The between-subject variability in the Vmax, CL and CLL was moderate to high, with estimated CVs ranging from 15 to 65. Measures of body size were the covariates most commonly identified as influencing the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic mAbs.In summary, many features of the population pharmacokinetics of currently used therapeutic mAbs are similar, despite differences in their pharmacological targets and studied patient populations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

Our new model, an integration and extension of several previously published models, includes aspects of mAb-FcRn dynamics within intracellular compartments not represented in previous PBPK models. We added mechanistic structure that details internalization of class G immunoglobulins by endothelial cells, subsequent FcRn binding, recycling into plasma of FcRn-bound IgG and degradation of free endosomal IgG. Degradation in liver is explicitly represented along with the FcRn submodel in skin and muscle. A variable tumor mass submodel is also included, used to estimate the growth of an avascular, necrotic tumor core, providing a more realistic picture of mAb uptake by tumor. We fitted the new multiscale model to published anti-CEA mAb biodistribution data, i.e. concentration-time profiles in tumor and various healthy tissues in mice, providing new estimates of mAb-FcRn related kinetic parameters. The model was further validated by successful prediction of F(ab′)2 mAb fragment biodistribution, providing additional evidence of its potential value in optimizing intact mAb and mAb fragment dosing for clinical imaging and immunotherapy applications. {\textcopyright} 2005 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

When compared with whole IgG, the Fab' fragment (a) is cleared from the body 35 times faster; (b) has a larger total distribution volume; (c) distributes more rapidly into this volume; (d) produces higher interstitial:plasma concentration ratios; (e) is catabolized principally by the kidney (73.4{\%} of total catabolism), followed by the gut (22.9{\%}), then the spleen (3.1{\%}); (f) is extracted from the circulation to the extent of 3.4{\%} on each pass through the kidney, and less by gut (1.0{\%}) and spleen (0.14{\%}) and (g) cycles through non-kidney interstitial spaces at least 0.4 cycles/g of tissue weight before metabolism or excretion. The F(ab' ‘)2 fragment has pharmacokinetic characteristics that fall between those of whole IgG and Fab'. These results (a) provide pharmacokinetic criteria for selecting whole IgG, F(ab')2 or Fab' for various in vivo applications; (b) provide a framework for predicting cumulative tissue exposure to antibody labeled with different isotopes; and (c) provide a reference metabolic state for the analysis of more complex systems that do include antibody binding. {\textcopyright} 1986, American Association for Cancer Research.

Investigative and bioanalytical tools need to be established to improve the translation of PK data from animals to humans, and from in vitro assays to in vivo readouts, which would ultimately lead to a higher success rate in drug development. In toxicology, it is known, in general, what studies are needed to safely develop therapeutic proteins, and what studies do not provide relevant information. One of the major complicating factors in nonclinical and clinical programs for therapeutic proteins is the impact of immunogenicity.

abstract = {The pH-dependent binding of Igs to the neonatal FcR (FcRn) plays a critical role in the in vivo homeostasis of IgGs. Modulating the interaction between Fc and FcRn through protein engineering is one method for improving the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic Abs. Recent studies disputed the direct relationship between increasing FcRn affinity and improved pharmacokinetic properties. In this work, we studied the pharmacokinetics of two human IgG1 Fc variants in cynomolgus monkey to further clarify the affinity-pharmacokinetic relationship. First, we report a number of novel Fc point mutations and combination variants, including some with primate-specific FcRn-binding improvements. By studying these variants along with some previously described variants across a wide range of affinities, we discovered a direct correlation of pH 6 affinity improvements with neutral pH improvements, suggesting that all of the tested variants exhibit similar pH dependency in FcRn binding. We then evaluated the pharmacokinetics of variants N434A and N434W, which, respectively, gave approximately 4- and 80-fold improvements in pH 6-binding affinity to both human and nonhuman primate FcRn. Surprisingly, clearance of N434W was similar to that of wild type. N434W is the first variant studied in primates that exhibits significant binding to FcRn at pH 7.4, and its clearance substantiates the principle that too much affinity improvement, i.e., beyond that of N434W, does not yield improved pharmacokinetics. In contrast, N434A exhibited a approximately 2-fold decrease in clearance in cynomolgus monkey, supporting the notion that modest increases in pH 6 FcRn affinity can result in improved pharmacokinetics in primates.},

abstract = {Here, we investigated the influence of the variable fragment (Fv) of IgG antibodies on the binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) as well as on FcRn-dependent pharmacokinetics (PK). FcRn plays a key role in IgG homeostasis, and specific manipulation in the crystallizable fragment (Fc) is known to affect FcRn-dependent PK. Although the influence of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) on FcRn interactions has been reported, the underlying mechanism is hitherto only poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed the two IgG1 antibodies, briakinumab and ustekinumab, that have similar Fc parts but different terminal half-lives in human and systematically engineered variants of them with cross-over exchanges and varied charge distribution. Using FcRn affinity chromatography, molecular dynamics simulation, and in vivo PK studies in human FcRn transgenic mice, we provide evidence that the charge distribution on the Fv domain is involved in excessive FcRn binding. This excessive binding prevents efficient FcRn-IgG dissociation at physiological pH, thereby reducing FcRn-dependent terminal half-lives. Furthermore, we observed a linear correlation between FcRn column retention times of the antibody variants and the terminal half-lives in vivo. Taken together, our study contributes to a better understanding of the FcRn - IgG interaction, and it could also provide profound potential in FcRn-dependent antibody engineering of the variable Fab region.},

This antibody binds to the rat recycling receptor FcRn as expected for a human IgG1 antibody and does not display nonspecific binding to baculovirus particles in an assay that is correlated with fast clearance in cynomolgus monkey. The antigen is not expressed in rat so target-dependent clearance does not contribute to PK. Removal of the affinity maturation changes (hu5B3.k1VH3.v1) did not restore normal clearance. The antibody was re-humanized on a k4, VH1 framework and the non-affinity matured version (hu5B3.k4VH1.v1) was shown to have normal clearance (8.5 mL/day/ kg). Since the change in framework results in a lower pI, primarily due to more negative charge on the k4 template, the effect of additional charge variation on antibody PK was tested by incorporating substitutions obtained through phage display affinity maturation of hu5B3.k1VH3.v1. A variant having a pI of 8.61 gave very fast clearance (140 mL/day/kg) whereas a molecule with pI of 6.10 gave slow clearance (5.8 mL/kg/day). Both antibodies exhibited comparable binding to rat FcRn, but biodistribution experiments showed that the high pI variant was catabolized in liver and spleen. These results suggest antibody charge can have an effect on PK through alterations in antibody catabolism independent of FcRn-mediated recycling. Furthermore, introduction of affinity maturation changes into the lower pI framework yielded a candidate with PK and virus neutralization properties suitable for clinical development.},

abstract = {A large body of data exists demonstrating that neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding of an IgG via its Fc CH2-CH3 interface trends with the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IgG. We have observed that PK of IgG molecules vary widely, even when they share identical Fc domains. This led us to hypothesize that domains distal from the Fc could contribute to FcRn binding and affect PK. In this study, we explored the role of these IgG domains in altering the affinity between IgG and FcRn. Using a surface plasmon resonance-based assay developed to examine the steady-state binding affinity (KD) of IgG molecules to FcRn, we dissected the contributions of IgG domains in modulating the affinity between FcRn and IgG. Through analysis of a broad collection of therapeutic antibodies containing more than 50 unique IgG molecules, we demonstrated that variable domains, and in particular complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), significantly alter binding affinity to FcRn in vitro. Furthermore, a panel of IgG molecules differing only by 1–5 mutations in CDRs altered binding affinity to FcRn in vitro, by up to 79-fold, and the affinity values correlated with calculated isoelectric point values of both variable domains and CDR-L3. In addition, tighter affinity values trend with faster in vivo clearance of a set of IgG molecules differing only by 1–3 mutations in human FcRn transgenic mice. Understanding the role of CDRs in modulation of IgG affinity to FcRn in vitro and their effect on PK of IgG may have far-reaching implications in the optimization of IgG therapeutics.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of small and large molecule therapeutics differ significantly from one another and can be explored within the framework of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. This paper briefly reviews fundamental approaches to PBPK modeling, in which drug kinetics within tissues and organs are explicitly represented using physiologically meaningful parameters. The differences in PBPK models applied to small/large molecule drugs are highlighted, thus elucidating differences in absorption, distribution and elimination properties between these two classes of drugs in a systematic manner. The absorption of small and large molecules differs with respect to their common extravascular routes of delivery (oral versus subcutaneous). The role of the lymphatic system in drug distribution, and the involvement of tissues as sites of elimination (through catabolism and target mediated drug disposition) are unique features of antibody distribution and elimination that differ from small molecules, which are commonly distributed into the tissues but are eliminated primarily by liver metabolism. Fundamental differences exist in the ability to predict human pharmacokinetics based upon preclinical data due to differing mechanisms governing small and large molecule disposition. These differences have influence on the evolving utilization of PBPK modeling in the discovery and development of small and large molecule therapeutics.},

To address this, we have developed a mAb physiologically based PK (PBPK) model that describes the intracellular trafficking and FcRn recycling of mAbs in hFcRn Tg32 mouse and human. This model utilises mAb specific in vitro data together with species specific FcRn tissue expression, tissue volume and blood flow physiology to predict mAb in vivo linear PK a priori. The model accurately predicts the terminal half-life of 90{\%} of the mAbs investigated within 2-fold error. The mechanistic nature of this model allows us to not only predict linear PK from in vitro data but explore PK and target binding of mAbs engineered to have pH dependent binding to its target or FcRn and could aid in the selection of mAbs with optimal PKPD properties.

abstract = {Exposure to acute or chronic hypoxaemia in otherwise healthy humans results in compensatory increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) at rest and during exercise referred to as hypoxic cerebral vasodilatation. These elevations in CBF offset the reduction in arterial oxygen content (CaO2 ) and maintain cerebral O2 delivery (CDO2 ) conforming to the conservation of mass principle. In this review, we discuss the fundamental principles that contribute to the defence of CDO2 and the corresponding implications for metabolism. We critically address to what extent the increase in CBF reflects an adaptive or indeed maladaptive physiological response. The molecular mechanisms of CBF regulation in hypoxia are also briefly discussed and future directions proposed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s). Background: Accurate estimation of the isoelectric point (pI) based on the amino acid sequence is useful for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques such as 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or capillary isoelectric focusing used in combination with high-throughput mass spectrometry. Additionally, pI estimation can be helpful during protein crystallization trials. Results: Here, I present the Isoelectric Point Calculator (IPC), a web service and a standalone program for the accurate estimation of protein and peptide pI using different sets of dissociation constant (pKa) values, including two new computationally optimized pKa sets. According to the presented benchmarks, the newly developed IPC pKa sets outperform previous algorithms by at least 14.9 {\%} for proteins and 0.9 {\%} for peptides (on average, 22.1 {\%} and 59.6 {\%}, respectively), which corresponds to an average error of the pI estimation equal to 0.87 and 0.25 pH units for proteins and peptides, respectively. Moreover, the prediction of pI using the IPC pKa's leads to fewer outliers, i.e., predictions affected by errors greater than a given threshold. Conclusions: The IPC service is freely available at http://isoelectric.ovh.org Peptide and protein datasets used in the study and the precalculated pI for the PDB and some of the most frequently used proteomes are available for large-scale analysis and future development.

abstract = {Objectives: Our objectives were to compare and contrast abciximab concentration-effect relationships in healthy volunteer participants with those in patients with coronary atherosclerosis undergoing elective coronary angioplasty. We also aimed to establish abciximab plasma concentrations associated with 80{\%} inhibition of platelet aggregation. Methods: Abciximab clearance and concentration-effect relationships were determined from two separate clinical studies, one in 30 healthy subjects aged 21 to 66 years and the other in 32 patients aged 44 to 74 years before they underwent elective coronary angioplasty. After abciximab administration, abciximab plasma concentrations, platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) receptor occupancy, and degree of inhibition of platelet aggregation in the presence of 5-$\mu$mol/L and 20-$\mu$mol/L adenosine diphosphate was determined. With an E max (receptor occupancy) or inhibitory E max (inhibition of platelet aggregation) model, abciximab concentrations required for 80{\%} receptor occupancy and 80{\%} inhibition of platelet aggregation were determined. Results: Abciximab steady-state clearance in healthy participants was 183 ± 72 ml/min (mean ± SD), and single-dose clearance in patients undergoing angioplasty was 405 ± 240 ml/min (mean ± SD). Abciximab concentration required for 80{\%} GP IIb/IIIa receptor occupancy was 35.2 ± 2.4 versus 72.8 ± 6.4 ng/ml in healthy participants versus patients (P {\textless} .01). Concentrations required for 80{\%} inhibition of platelet aggregation stimulated by 5-$\mu$mol/L adenosine diphosphate were 25.6 ± 1.6 versus 68.9 ± 9.2 ng/ml (P {\textless} .01). Similarly, the concentrations required for 80{\%} inhibition of platelet aggregation stimulated by 20-$\mu$mol/L adenosine diphosphate were 56.0 ± 3.2 versus 141 ± 16.8 ng/ml (P {\textless} .01). Conclusion: Approximately 2-fold greater abciximab exposure is required to achieve the same degree of GP IIb/IIIa occupancy and inhibition of platelet aggregation in patients undergoing angioplasty as compared with healthy participants. The difference between groups may be related either to different states of basal platelet activation or to the effect of heparin that patients received as part of the angioplasty procedure. A therapeutic concentration range for patients is 100 to 175 ng/ml, because this is the concentration consistent with {\textgreater}80{\%} inhibition of platelet aggregation when 20-$\mu$mol/L adenosine diphosphate is used as the aggregating stimulus.},

abstract = {Objectives: To understand the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa) and to continue to optimize dosing regimens by determining whether administration of single high doses of epoetin alfa is as effective as repeated administration. Methods: Epoetin alfa was administered as single subcutaneous doses of 300, 450, 600, 900, 1200, 1350, 1800, and 2400 IU/kg and in multiple subcutaneous dose regimens: 150 IU/kg 3 times a week for 4: weeks and 600 IU/kg once per week for 4 weeks in 2 open-label, randomized placebo-controlled studies in healthy volunteers. Results: The absorption rate of epoetin alfa after subcutaneous administration was independent of dose, whereas clearance was dose-dependent in that it decreased with increasing dose. There was a linear relationship between response measured as percentage of reticulocytes area under the curve (AUC) and erythropoietin AUC for single doses up to 1800 IU/kg. Beyond the 1800 IU/kg dose, there was a saturation of response. The mean percentage of reticulocytes after single-dose regimens began to increase by days 3 to 4, reached their maximum at days 8 to 11, and returned to baseline values by day 22. In contrast, the mean percentage of reticulocytes after both multiple-dose regimens were maintained above baseline values through day 22 as both regimens stimulated modest but sustained increases in percentage of reticulocytes (1{\%} to 2{\%}). The mean percentage of reticulocytes AUC for 600 IU/kg epoetin alfa given once a week for 4 weeks was apparently greater than the mean percentage of reticulocytes AUC for 150 IU/kg 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Although daily oral iron supplementation was given, mean serum ferritin levels declined by approximately 75{\%} through day 22 in subjects treated with multiple doses of epoetin alfa. Conclusions: These findings show that the pharmacologic response to epoetin alfa is a function of dose and dosing regimen. Repeated administration of epoetin alfa was more effective in stimulating a reticulocyte response than single-dose administration of the same total amount of epoetin alfa.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of afelimomab, a murine antibody fragment against human tumor necrosis factor “TNF”-$\alpha$ in patients with sepsis. Design: Multicenter, randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled phase I/II clinical trial. Setting: Intensive care units of six academic medical centers in the United States. Patients: Forty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of sepsis who received standard supportive care and antimicrobial therapy. Interventions: Patients received 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg afelimomab or placebo intravenously over 20 min. Three patients in each dose group received single doses; the remaining nine patients in each group received multiple “nine” doses at 8-h intervals over 72 h. Measurements and main results: Afelimomab appeared safe and well tolerated. Single- and multiple-dose kinetics were predictable and dose related. The elimination half-life was 44.7 h. Afelimomab treatment resulted in increased serum concentrations of TNF “includes TNF-anti-body complexes” and decreased serum interleukin-6 concentrations, whereas no discernible trends were observed in placebo-treated patients. There was no significant treatment effect on 28-day mortality as was expected given the small number of patients. However, overall mortality was significantly “p = 0.001” associated with baseline interleukin-6 concentration. All patients experienced adverse events, but the vast majority were considered unrelated to the study drug and demonstrated no apparent relationship to afelimomab dose. Although 41{\%} of patients developed human anti-murine antibodies, there were no clinical sequelae. Conclusions: Multidose therapy with afelimomab was safe, well tolerated, and had predictable linear kinetics. A large randomized trial comparing afelimomab to placebo in patients with well defined sepsis has recently been completed.},

abstract = {An integrated structural pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model was developed for the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist abciximab administered to patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. PK/PD data, in the form of plasma abciximab concentrations and ex vivo platelet aggregation in the presence of 20 microM adenosine diphosphate, were obtained from two previously conducted clinical studies. Study 1 consisted of patients who were given abciximab as a single intravenous injection of 0.25 mg/kg (n = 32). Patients in study 2 received an identical bolus dose, followed by a 36-h infusion at 0.125 microg/kg/min (n = 15). The PK component of the final model included drug-receptor binding, nonspecific distribution, and linear systemic clearance, whereas the PD module assumed that ex vivo dynamics were controlled by free plasma drug concentration. Mean PK/PD data from both studies were fitted simultaneously using nonlinear regression. PK profiles from both studies show rapidly decreasing plasma abciximab concentrations at early time points, but with extended terminal disposition phases. The maximum effect (Emax = 83.6{\%}) was achieved rapidly and gradually returned to baseline values, although inhibition could be measured long after abciximab concentrations dropped below the detection limit. The final model well described the resulting PK/PD profiles and allowed for parameter estimation with relatively small coefficients of variation. Simulations were conducted to assess predicted receptor-occupancy and effects of selected parameters on PK/PD profiles. Models such as the one developed in this study demonstrate how drug binding to pharmacological targets may influence the PK of certain drugs and also provide a suitable paradigm for defining the PK/PD relationships of similar compounds.},

abstract = {This report summarizes the pharmacokinetics in humans of recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2) given as an i.v. bolus, i.v. or i.p. infusion, and i.m. or s.c. injection. Immediately after an i.v. bolus the serum IL-2 level equals the dose divided by the plasma volume, in a typical human 650 units/ml for a dose of 104 units/m2. The level initially decreases with a half-life of 12.9 min, followed by a slower phase with a half-life of 85 min out to 4 h after the bolus. The median steady state level during an i.v. infusion of 104 units/m2 over 6 h is 41 units/ml. A clearance rate of approximately 120 ml/min is obtained from either the i.v. bolus or infusion data and is consistent with the renal filtration being the major route of clearance. Serum levels remain fairly constant for about 8 h after s.c. or i.m. injection but are approximately 2{\%} of the level seen immediately after an i.v. bolus. The area under the time-concentration curve suggests that about 30{\%} of the IL-2 activity is transported from the site of an i.m. injection to the blood. After i.p. infusion IL-2 is only slowly transported to the blood. The median serum IL-2 levels are 430-fold lower than levels in the i.p. fluid and decrease with a median half-life of 63 h. {\textcopyright} 1990, American Association for Cancer Research.

abstract = {Purpose. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is predominantly bound to its specific binding proteins (IGFBPs) in circulating plasma. In the present study, pharmacokinetic analysis of IGF-1 was performed in healthy volunteers to characterize the effect of interactions with IGFBPs on IGF-1 disposition. Methods. Plasma concentration profiles of both free and bound IGF-1 were examined at several doses. An in vitro plasma protein binding was also analyzed. Results. The total body clearance (CL total ) for the free IGF-1 was much higher than the creatinine clearance, suggesting that the major elimination pathway is by a route other than renal glomerular filtration. The CL total for the free IGF-1 exhibited a dose-dependent reduction whereas that for the sum of unbound and bound IGF-1 increased on increasing the dose. The data obtained fitted closely a one-compartment model that involved the binding and dissociation of IGF-1, as well as its biosynthesis and elimination. The estimated parameters suggest that IGF-1 exhibits high affinity binding to IGFBPs, the rate-limiting step in the overall elimination being the dissociation from IGFBPs. Conclusions. The saturation of both the plasma protein binding and elimination accounts for the nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile. The binding to IGFBPs markedly limits both the distribution and elimination of IGF-1.},

abstract = {Etanercept, a fully humanized soluble recombinant tumor necrosis factor receptor fusion protein, is an approved treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis. Etanercept is absorbed slowly from the site of subcutaneous injection, with time to peak concentration at approximately 48 to 60 hours, and is cleared slowly from the body with a t(1/2) of 70 to 100 hours. The absolute bioavailability of etanercept was 58{\%} in healthy subjects following subcutaneous administration. The 25-mg twice-weekly dosage regimen generates systemic exposures comparable to 50 mg once weekly, as predicted by pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation and later confirmed by clinical studies. The pharmacokinetics of etanercept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are comparable to those in healthy individuals and patients with ankylosing spondylitis, congestive heart failure, and psoriasis. In children with polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, after subcutaneous doses of 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly, the clearance of etanercept may be slightly reduced in children aged 4 to 8 years. Pharmacokinetic simulation predicts that a dose of 0.8 mg/kg once weekly generates comparable systemic exposure as 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly. No requirement for etanercept dosage adjustment is needed when etanercept is coadministered with warfarin, digoxin, or methotrexate.},

abstract = {Objective: HD203 is a biosimilar of etanercept, a fusion protein of the ligand-binding portion of the human tumor necrosis factor receptor II linked to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. Since HD203 is under clinical development, this study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of HD203 with Enbrel{\textregistered}, the first marketed etanercept. Methods: A double-blind, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study was conducted in 37 healthy volunteers. In each period, 25mg/mL of reconstituted lyophilized reference (Enbrel{\textregistered}) or test product (HD203) was administered subcutaneously, either the reference product followed by the test product, or vice versa. Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken for 480 hours after dosing, and serum concentrations of the products were determined using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The geometric mean ratios with 90{\%} confidence intervals for the maximum concentration (C max ) and the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable time point (AUC 0-t ) were estimated. Results: A total of 35 subjects completed the study; serious adverse events were not observed. The mean serum concentration-time profiles of the two products were similar. The C max and AUC 0-t values of the reference product (mean ± standard deviation) were 1.25 ± 0.45 mg/L and 283.15 ± 98.57 mg*h/L, respectively, while those of the test drug were 1.35 ± 0.47 mg/L and 315.78 ± 99.38 mg*h/L, respectively. The geometric mean ratios (90{\%} confidence intervals) of the test to the reference for C max and AUC 0-t were 1.08 (1.00, 1.16) and 1.13 (1.05, 1.21), respectively. Conclusions: A single subcutaneous injection of HD203 or Enbrel{\textregistered} into healthy volunteers appeared to be safe and well tolerated. Comparative pharmacokinetics demonstrated that reconstituted lyophilized HD203 has bioavailability similar to that of Enbrel{\textregistered}. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer International Publishing AG.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the pharmacokinetics of etanercept when administered by subcutaneous injection in single doses to healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty-six healthy volunteers between 19 and 50 years of age received single doses of etanercept 25 mg by subcutaneous injection into the abdomen. Serial serum samples were collected for 21 days. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a quantitation limit of 0.3 ng/mL was used to measure the drug concentrations. RESULTS: Etanercept was well tolerated by healthy volunteers. A one-compartment model was found to best describe the concentration-time data and was used to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters. Etanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of injection with a time of peak concentration (+/- SD) of 51 +/- 14 hours; peak concentration was 1.46 +/- 0.72 mg/L. The AUC was 235 +/-98 mg x h/L, apparent clearance was 132 +/- 85 mL/h, apparent volume of distribution was 12 +/- 6 L, and the half-life was 68 +/- 19 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Etanercept was slowly absorbed and slowly eliminated after subcutaneous administration. Dosing at the recommended rate of 25 mg twice weekly would be expected to result in concentrations of approximately 3 mg/L. Intersubject variability for apparent clearance in healthy volunteers was 64{\%}.},

The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of repeated subcutaneous low-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on parameters associated with improved procurement of autologous blood; a procedure regularly used to preclude the need for homologous blood transfusion at the time of elective surgery. 2. Three groups of three volunteers each (n = 9) were administered one of three low doses of rHuEPO (30, 60 or 100 IU/kg bodyweight, s.c.) on days 1, 4 and 8. The plasma pharmacokinetic profile of rHuEPO was studied after the first and third injections. Statistical evaluations were intragroup and intraindividual comparisons. 3. There was a linear relationship between maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and dose. In the overall study group, C(max) and area under the curve (AUC) were significantly decreased, while the mean residence time (MRT) and elimination half-life (t( 1/2 $\beta$)) were significantly increased on day 8 relative to day 1. Significant and sustained increases in reticulocytes were observed after rHuEPO administration, which were maintained above the predose values throughout the study period. 4. In conclusion, rHuEPO, by subcutaneous repeat-dose, was eliminated more slowly and remained longer in the circulation, despite lowered plasma concentrations. Repeated low rHuEPO administration at doses ≥60 IU/kg bodyweight stimulated modest but sustained reticulocyte concentrations, suggesting that cost may be substantially decreased in autologous blood donation or perioperative treatment programmes.},

Data were obtained from 4 clinical studies carried out in healthy volunteers. Epoetin alfa (rHuEpo) was administered as 5 single IV doses ranging from 10 to 500 IU/kg, as 8 single SC doses ranging from 300 to 2400 IU/kg, andas 2 multiple SC dosage regimens (150 IU/kg/3 times a week [tiw] and 600 IU/kg/wk). A dual-absorption rate model (fast zero-order and slow first-order inputs) with nonlinear disposition characterized the PK of SC rHuEpo. A high K m value was obtained indicating that clearance was mildly nonlinear. Absorption was slow (t max ∼24 hours), and the bioavailability of SC rHuEpo increased with dose (ranging from 46{\%}-100{\%}). A catenary cell production and loss model with a feedback down regulation component was used to fit the reticulocyte data yielding estimates of the stimulatory capacity (S max ), sensitivity (SC 50 ), and life span parameters. These parameters were used for simulations of RBC and Hb profiles. An SC 50 of 27 to 61 IU/L was estimated indicating that low physiological plasma rHuEpo concentrations were sufficient to produce pharmacological effects. No marked sex-dependent differences in clinical responses to rHuEpo therapy were found despite baseline differences. Realistic pharmacokinetic and physiological models accounted for clinical responses from a wide array of dosing conditions with rHuEpo. The rationale for greater efficacy of SC administration of rHuEpo compared to IV was ascertained.},

Bioavailability and bioactivity of three different doses of nasal growth hormone (GH) administered to GH-deflcient patients: comparison with intravenous and subcutaneous administration. Eur J Endocrinol 1996;135:309–15. ISSN 0804–4643 The current mode of growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy is daily subcutaneous (sc) injections given in the evening. This schedule is unable to mimic the endogenous pulsatile pattern of GH secretion, which might be of importance for the induction of growth and other GH actions. The present study was conducted in order to study the pharmacokinetics of different doses of GH following intranasal (IN) administration and the biological activity of GH after IN administration as compared with sc and intravenous (iv) delivery. Sixteen GH-deficient patients were studied on five different occasions. On three occasions GH was administered intranasally in doses of 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20IU/kg, using didecanoyl- l -$\alpha$-phosphatidylcholine as an enhancer. On the other two occasions the patients received an sc injection (0.10IU/kg) and an iv injection (0.015IU/kg) of GH, respectively. The nasal doses and the sc injection were given in random order in a crossover design. In a double-blinded manner the subjects received the three nasal doses as one puff in each nostril. The patients received no GH treatment between the five studies or during the last week before the start of each study. Intravenous administration produced a short-lived serum GH peak value of 128.12 ± 6.71 $\mu$g/l. Peak levels were 13.98±1.63 $\mu$g/l after sc injection and 3.26±0.38. 7.07±0.80 and 8.37± 1.31 $\mu$g/l, respectively, after the three nasal doses. The peak values of the 0.05 and the 0.20IU/kg nasal doses were significantly different (p = 0.007). The mean levels obtained by the low nasal dose were significantly lower than those obtained with the medium (p {\textless} 0.001) and the high dose (p {\textless} 0.001). while there was no significant difference between the medium and the high doses. The absolute bioavailability of GH following sc relative to iv administration was 49.5{\%}. The bioavailabilities of the nasal doses were: 7.8{\%} (0.05 IU), 8.9{\%} (0.10 IU) and 3.8{\%} (0.20 IU). Serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels increased significantly after sc administration only. Mean levels were significantly higher after sc administration as compared with the iv and all three nasal does (p {\textless} 0.001). Serum IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels remained unchanged on all five occasions. Mean serum IGFBP-1 levels were significantly lower after sc GH injection than after administration of the iv (p {\textless} 0.001) and the three nasal doses (p {\textless} 0.005). Subcutaneous GH administration resulted in significantly higher levels of serum insulin and blood glucose (p {\textless} 0.001). In conclusion, the bioavailability of nasal GH was low (3.8–8.9{\%}). An iv bolus injection of, on average, 1 IU of GH induced no metabolic response. Only sc GH administration induced increased levels of IGF-I, insulin and glucose. These data reveal that a closer imitation of the physiological GH pulses than achieved by sc GH administration is of limited importance for the induction of a metabolic response to GH.

Single doses of IL-10 (8 $\mu$g/kg SC), IL-10 with prednisone (15 mg PO), placebo with prednisone, or placebo were administered on four separate occasions with at least 3-week interceding washout periods. Measurements included plasma prednisone, prednisolone and cortisol, unbound prednisolone, and serum IL-10 concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental and model-fitting analysis, while area analysis and an indirect response model were used to assess cortisol dynamics. IL-10 exhibited prolonged serum concentrations owing to dual-absorption processes that were largely unaffected by prednisone. The C(max) values were about 3 ng/mL, while the t(max) occurred at 7 to 9 hours. Prednisolone exhibited rapid systemic kinetics with a C(max) of 235 ng/mL, t(max) at 1.11 hours, and t(1/2) of 2.54 hours with no significant alterations owing to IL-10. Both prednisolone and prednisolone/IL-10 caused marked suppression of cortisol concentrations with similar magnitude and IC 50 values; however, IL-10 alone significantly increased the 24-hour AUC of cortisol by 20{\%}. Thus, IL-10 and prednisolone do not interact in disposition or adrenal suppression to a clinically significant degree. (C) 1999 the American College of Clinical Pharmacology.},

Methods: In 2 separate studies anakinra (1 mg/kg) was given intravenously to 12 healthy subjects and 20 subjects with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis. In a third study anakinra (100 mg) was given subcutaneously to 30 subjects who had been assigned to 5 groups according to renal function, as follows: normal (creatinine clearance [CLcr] {\textgreater}80 mL/min), mildly impaired (CLcr = 50-80 mL/min), moderately impaired (CLcr = 30-49 mL/min), severely impaired (CLcr {\textless}30 mL/min), and end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis. Plasma samples were collected up to 96 hours after dosing for anakinra measurement by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results: The mean plasma clearance (CL) of anakinra after intravenous administration was reduced from 137 ± 21 mL/min in the healthy subjects to approximately 20 mL/min for the subjects with end-stage renal disease (P {\textless} .0001). The removal of anakinra by dialysis was less than 2.5{\%} of the dose administered. Compared with mean anakinra clearance (CL/F) after subcutaneous administration in the group with normal renal function (170 ± 37 mL/min), CL/F was reduced by 16{\%} in the mildly impaired group (142 ± 59 mL/min), by 50{\%} in the moderately impaired group (84.5 ± 24.7 mL/min, P {\textless} .05), by 70{\%} in the severely impaired group (51.5 ± 8.4 mL/min, P {\textless} .05), and by 75{\%} in the group with end-stage renal disease (42.7 ± 4.7 mL/min, P {\textless} .05). A significant correlation between anakinra CL/F and CLcr was observed [log(CL/F) = 1.65 + 0.0062 {\textperiodcentered} CLcr; r2 = 0.718]. Conclusion: Anakinra is predominantly cleared renally in humans; the plasma clearance of anakinra decreased with decreasing renal function. The dialysis process has a minimal effect on the removal of anakinra. Our results suggest that a dose or schedule adjustment is indicated for persons with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneously administered interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). DESIGN: Open, dose-escalating phase I clinical trial. SETTING: Government research hospital. PATIENTS: Eighteen patients infected with HIV. INTERVENTIONS: Recombinant IL-2 at dosages of 12, 15, or 18 MIU/day was administered subcutaneously once or twice/day for 5 consecutive days every 2 months. A total of 28 cycles of therapy were included in the analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Concentrations of IL-2 in serum were determined by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Interleukin-2 was well absorbed, with peak concentrations from 21.9-112.9 IU/ml. Absorption was slow, with mean (+/- SD) time to maximum of 4.4 +/- 1.8 hours and a lag time of 26.9 +/- 13.7 minutes. Elimination half-life was 3.3 +/- 0.9 hours. The concentrations had wide variability both within and among patients. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were increased. Maximum body temperature and systemic side effects were associated with peak serum levels. CONCLUSION: Interleukin-2 is well absorbed after subcutaneous injection in HIV-infected patients, and that route of administration is an alternative to intravenous infusions.},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma following different subcutaneous (s.c.) administration regimens. METHODS: RhIL-2 was administered subcutaneously to 10 patients according to two different dosing regimens: group A received 20 x 10(6) IU m(-2) once daily and group B 10 x 10(6) IU m(-2) twice daily (every 12 h). Additionally, in all patients the influence of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) on the pharmacokinetics of rhIL-2 was investigated. RESULTS: The mean area under the serum concentration-time curve to 24 h (AUC(0,24 h)) was 627 IU ml(-1) h in treatment group A and 1130 IU ml(-1) h (P=0.029) in treatment group B. In both study groups Cmax and AUC(0,12 h) were not significantly different. Seventy-two hours after the beginning of s.c. rhIL-2 therapy the sIL-2R increased significantly (P=0.016), and sIL-2R levels over 1200 pmol l(-1) seemed to reduce the AUC. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with metastatic renal cell cancer administration of 20 x 10(6) IU m(-2) of rhIL-2 s.c. in two daily doses (10 x 10(6) IU m(-2) every 12 h) provides better bioavailability and is preferable to the single dose administration.},

However, by 12 to 14 hours after injection, serum IGF-1 was not different in the three groups. Although the T(max), area under the curve and serum clearance of IGF-1 were similar in the three groups, the half-life and volume of distribution of rhIGF-1 was significantly decreased in both MHD and CAPD patients.

abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) were studied in healthy volunteers and in patients with growth hormone receptor deficiency (GHRD; Laron syndrome). Following single subcutaneous injections of rhIGF-I, 40 and 80 $\mu$g/kg, to healthy volunteers, the peptide was absorbed slowly, with a maximum concentration reached after about 7 hours. Following daily multiple subcutaneous injections of rhIGF-I, 40 $\mu$g/kg, trough concentrations of IGF-I were increased by 277 ± 50 $\mu$g/l (mean ± SD) from baseline. IGF-I was thus characterized as a low-clearance peptide, with a clearance and half-life estimated at about 0.20 ml/minute/kg and 20 hours, respectively, in healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution was low, about 0.20-0.36 litres/kg, the bioavailability of subcutaneously administered rhIGF-I was 100{\%}, and the rate of production of IGF-I was estimated to be about 50 $\mu$g/kg/day (3.5 mg/day). Patients with GHRD had low baseline IGF-I concentrations (30-50 $\mu$g/l) and a much more rapid turnover of IGF-I compared with that in healthy volunteers. The clearance and half-life of IGF-I were estimated to be about 0.60 ml/minute/kg and 6 hours, respectively. The volume of distribution was about the same as in healthy subjects. Due to the rapid turnover of IGF-I, trough IGF-I concentrations were increased to just above baseline during subcutaneous injections of 40 $\mu$g/kg once daily for 7 days. The maximum increase in IGF-I levels was 111 ± 12 $\mu$g/l and 150 ± 3 $\mu$g/l following daily subcutaneous injections of 40 x 1 and 40 x 2 $\mu$g/kg for 7 days, respectively.},

abstract = {Background and aims: An 8-mm needle length is commonly used worldwide, and recent recommendations suggest that using shorter, 4-, 5-, or 6-mm needles may be optimal for most patients to avoid intramuscular injection and still maintain adequate glucose control. The goal of this analysis was to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of insulin lispro after administration at a 5-mm injection depth or an 8-mm injection depth in 2 separate populations: normal weight (Study 1) or obese (Study 2). Materials and methods: In both open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover euglycemic clamp studies, subjects received single doses of insulin lispro (0.25 U/kg) on 2 different occasions; PK and PD measures were collected under euglycemic conditions for up to approximately 6 hours post-dose. Results: In Study 1, 16 healthy normal weight subjects (13 male; age 31(plus or minus)9 years; BMI=23(plus or minus)2 kg/m2) were dosed at a 5-mm and an 8-mm injection depth on 2 separate occasions. In Study 2, 16 healthy obese subjects (11 male; mean age 41(plus or minus)11 years; BMI=34(plus or minus)3 kg/m2) were also dosed at a 5-mm and an 8-mm injection depth. In both studies, PK parameters [AUC(0-tlast), AUC(0-(infinity)), and Cmax] and PD parameters (Gtot, Rmax) were log-transformed prior to analysis using a mixed effects model. The table shows PK and PD parameters for both studies. Conclusion: There were no statistical differences in PK or PD of insulin lispro following administration at the 5-mm injection depth or 8-mm injection depth in either study. Injection depths in the 5-8 mm range did not affect the PK or PD of insulin lispro in either normal weight or obese subjects. These observations are consistent with clinical data in pediatric, adult, and obese patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, where the 5-mm needle was found to be as efficacious and safe as an 8-mm needle.

Pharmacokinetic data of insulin formulations with different onset and duration of action from several clinical studies, including insulin glargine, regular insulin, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), insulin lispro, and premixed preparations of NPH with regular insulin (Mix 70/30), and insulin lispro protamine suspension with insulin lispro (Mix 50/50, Mix 75/25), were used to develop a predictive population pharmacokinetic model of insulins with consideration of factors such as insulin formulation, weight-based dosing, bodyweight effect on volume of distribution, and administration time relative to meals, on the insulin time-action profile. The model-predicted insulin profile of each insulin was validated and confirmed to be comparable to observed data via an external validation method. Model-based simulations of clinically relevant insulin-dosing scenarios to cater to specific initial patient and prescribing conditions were then implemented with differential equations using the R statistical program (version 3.2.2). The R package Shiny was subsequently applied to build a web browser interface to execute and visualize the model simulation outputs. The application of insulin pharmacokinetic modeling enabled informative visualization of insulin time-action profiles and provided an efficient and intuitive educational tool to quickly convey and interactively explore many insulin time-action profiles to ease the understanding of insulin formulations in clinical practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa after intravenous (IV) administration in the oncology setting have not been previously reported. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of IV or subcutaneous (SC) darbepoetin alfa in patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing multicycle chemotherapy. METHODS: Fifty-six patients (haemoglobin {\textless}or=13.0 g/dL) received weekly darbepoetin alfa 2.25 microg/kg administered either IV (n=27) or SC (n=29) during up to three cycles of chemotherapy. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed, including analysis of intensive pharmacokinetic profiles collected over 168 hours during week 1 of both the first and third cycles of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Darbepoetin alfa serum concentrations exhibited a biphasic profile (a rapid distributive phase followed by a slower terminal elimination phase) after IV administration, whereas darbepoetin alfa was slowly absorbed after SC administration. Darbepoetin alfa exhibited limited extravascular distribution after IV administration, with both initial and steady-state mean volumes of distribution (36.1 mL/kg and 55.2 mL/kg, respectively, after a single IV dose) approximating the plasma volume. After a single IV dose, darbepoetin alfa exhibited a mean clearance of 1.05 mL/h/kg, with a mean terminal half-life of 38.8 hours. Similar pharmacokinetic results were observed after single and multiple doses of darbepoetin alfa, for both SC and IV administration. CONCLUSION: Darbepoetin alfa is cleared slowly after IV administration to patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy, resulting in a terminal half-life of 38.8 hours. No evidence of accumulation and no changes in pharmacokinetic profiles after repeated administration were observed in cancer patients undergoing cyclic chemotherapy, for both IV and SC dosing.},

abstract = {Peptides, defined as polymers of less than 50 amino acids with a molecular weight of less than 10 kDa, represent a fast-growing class of new therapeutics which has unique pharmacokinetic characteristics compared to large proteins or small molecule drugs. Unmodified peptides usually undergo extensive proteolytic cleavage, resulting in short plasma half-lives. As a result of their low permeability and susceptibility to catabolic degradation, therapeutic peptides usually have very limited oral bioavailability and are administered either by the intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular route, although other routes such as nasal delivery are utilized as well. Distribution processes are mainly driven by a combination of diffusion and to a lesser degree convective extravasation dependent on the size of the peptide, with volumes of distribution frequently not larger than the volume of the extracellular body fluid. Owing to the ubiquitous availability of proteases and peptidases throughout the body, proteolytic degradation is not limited to classic elimination organs. Since peptides are generally freely filtered by the kidneys, glomerular filtration and subsequent renal metabolism by proteolysis contribute to the elimination of many therapeutic peptides. Although small peptides have usually limited immunogenicity, formation of anti-drug antibodies with subsequent hypersensitivity reactions has been described for some peptide therapeutics. Numerous strategies have been applied to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic peptides, especially to overcome their metabolic instability, low permeability, and limited tissue residence time. Applied techniques include amino acid substitutions, modification of the peptide terminus, inclusion of disulfide bonds, and conjugation with polymers or macromolecules such as antibody fragments or albumin. Application of model-based pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic correlations has been w idely used for therapeutic peptides in support of drug development and dosage regimen design, especially because their targets are often well-described endogenous regulatory pathways and processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Model-Based Meta-Analysis (MBMA) is a valuable component of the quantitative pharmacology toolkit for model-informed drug discovery and development. It enables principled decision-making with a Totality of Evidence mindset through integration of internal and external data across multiple dimensions (e.g., targets/ mechanisms, molecules/ drugs, doses/ regimens, diseases/ indications, populations, endpoints and clinical trial designs). MBMA distinguishes itself from traditional meta-analysis by infusing pharmacologic plausibility into the statistical rigor that typifies meta-analytic data integration. This is possible through mechanism-informed formulation of pharmacologically inspired cause-effect and dose-response relationships, time course of treatment effects and inter-relationships between proximal and distal outcomes of modulation of disease biology and pathophysiology. In this review, we offer a question-based approach to enhance appreciation of the value of MBMA across the continuum from drug discovery and translational research through clinical development, comparative effectiveness research and post-approval optimization of therapeutics using illustrative examples across therapeutic areas.

abstract = {Reproducibility of computational studies is a hallmark of scientific methodology. It enables researchers to build with confidence on the methods and findings of others, reuse and extend computational pipelines, and thereby drive scientific progress. Since many experimental studies rely on computational analyses, biologists need guidance on how to set up and document reproducible data analyses or simulations. In this paper, we address several questions about reproducibility. For example, what are the technical and non-technical barriers to reproducible computational studies? What opportunities and challenges do computational notebooks offer to overcome some of these barriers? What tools are available and how can they be used effectively? We have developed a set of rules to serve as a guide to scientists with a specific focus on computational notebook systems, such as Jupyter Notebooks, which have become a tool of choice for many applications. Notebooks combine detailed workflows with narrative text and visualization of results. Combined with software repositories and open source licensing, notebooks are powerful tools for transparent, collaborative, reproducible, and reusable data analyses.},

abstract = {Two-pore physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models can be expected to describe the tissue distribution and elimination kinetics of soluble proteins, endogenous or dosed, as function of their size. In this work, we amalgamated our previous two-pore PBPK model for an inert domain antibody (dAb) in mice with the cross-species platform PBPK model for monoclonal antibodies described in literature into a unified two-pore platform that describes protein modalities of different sizes and includes neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) mediated recycling. This unified PBPK model was parametrized for organ-specific lymph flow rates and the endosomal recycling rate constant using an extended tissue distribution time-course dataset that included an inert dAb, albumin and IgG in rats and mice. The model was evaluated by comparing the ab initio predictions for the tissue distribution and elimination properties of albumin-binding dAbs (AlbudAbsTM) in mice and rats with the experimental observations. Due to the large number of molecular species and reactions involved in large-scale PBPK models, we have also developed and deployed a MatlabTM script for automating the assembly of SimBiologyTM-based two-pore biologics PBPK models which drastically cuts the time and effort required for model building.},

The number of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have already been approved for therapeutic applications and for use in clinical trials have significantly increased in the past few years. In view of the side effects and limitations of mAbs, several improvements and modifications to monoclonal antibodies have been developed. These modifications have facilitated the use of mAbs in various forms of therapeutic applications such as treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic organisms. Monoclonal antibodies have also been applied in the treatment of non-infectious diseases such as cancer, immune diseases, arthritis and other disorders resulting from organ transplantation. This review highlights mAbs applications in biomedicine, and discusses state-of-the-art technologies related to their potential uses.},

abstract = {Subcutaneous (SC) injection is currently the most common route of self-administering biopharmaceuticals such as proteins and peptides. While pharmaceutical scientists have acquired great skill in identifying formulations for these proteins and peptides with multi-year shelf life stability, the SC injection of these formulations can result in inconsistent or particularly low bioavailability outcomes. We hypothesise that upon injection, the chemical, physical and physiological properties of the subcutaneous tissue may play a crucial role in determining the therapeutic outcomes of SC injected biopharmaceuticals. We contend that physical and chemical stresses placed upon the injected protein or peptide as it transitions from the non-physiological environment of its formulation to the homeostatic conditions of the SC tissue can affect its fate following injection, and that by taking this environment into account when formulating, more precisely controlled release of SC injected biopharmaceuticals could be achieved. In this mini-review we describe how events that occur to an injected protein or peptide during this post-injection transition period could affect the diffusion of bioactive material to blood capillaries and lymphatic vessels. With this in mind, we have reviewed the chemical, physical and physiological attributes of the SC tissue and collated studies on how these properties are known to affect protein stability and diffusional properties. Finally, examples where the understanding of the properties of the SC tissue when formulating for SC injected biopharmaceuticals has improved the predictability of drug delivery via the SC route are discussed, with the need for novel tools for rational and informed formulation development highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {More than 20 monoclonal antibodies have been approved as therapeutic drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration, and it is quite likely that the number of approved antibodies will double in the next 7-10 years. Antibody drugs show several desirable characteristics, including good solubility and stability, long persistence in the body, high selectivity and specificity, and low risk for bioconversion to toxic metabolites. However, many antibody drugs demonstrate attributes that complicate drug development, including very poor oral bioavailability, incomplete absorption following intramuscular or subcutaneous administration, nonlinear distribution, and nonlinear elimination. In addition, antibody administration often leads to an endogenous antibody response, which may alter the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the therapeutic antibody. Antibodies have been developed for a wide range of disease conditions, with effects produced through a complex array of mechanisms. This article attempts to provide a brief overview of the main determinants of antibody pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of two drug delivery devices on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ixekizumab as well as efficacy and safety with both devices. METHODS In the first 12 weeks of an open-label, phase 3 study, moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients were randomized to ixekizumab delivery via PFS or autoinjector device. Randomization was stratified by weight ({\textless}80 kg, 80-100 kg, {\textgreater}100 kg), injection assistance (yes/no) and injection site (arm, thigh or abdomen). Following a 160-mg initial dose at week 0, patients received subcutaneous 80-mg ixekizumab as a single injection every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Blood samples were collected following the initial 160-mg dose on days 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 for PK analysis. Primary PK parameters were maximum concentration (Cmax ) and area under the curve (AUC0-tlast ) where tlast is the time of last sample (14 days ± 24 h). Efficacy was assessed by percent improvement on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at week 12. Adverse event reporting, vital signs and clinical laboratory data were used to evaluate safety. RESULTS Of 204 randomized patients, 192 were included in the PK analysis (PFS: 94; autoinjector: 98). The PFS and autoinjector showed similar geometric mean Cmax (90{\%} CI) [15.0 $\mu$g/mL (13.9-16.1) vs. 14.8 $\mu$g/mL (13.8-15.9)] and geometric mean AUC0-tlast (90{\%} CI) [157 $\mu$g × day/mL (147-168) vs. 154 $\mu$g × day/mL (144-165)]. When comparing Cmax and AUC0-tlast of the autoinjector to PFS, the geometric LS mean ratios were 0.97. At week 12, mean percent PASI improvement (via modified baseline observation carried forward) was similar with the PFS (89.3{\%}) and autoinjector (86.9{\%}). Both devices had safety results that were consistent with the known safety profile of ixekizumab. CONCLUSION The PK, efficacy and safety of ixekizumab administered subcutaneously by PFS and autoinjector were similar.

abstract = {Background: DX-2930 is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein under investigationfor long-term prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema.
Objective: To assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of DX-2930 in healthysubjects.
Methods: A single-center, double-blinded study was performed in 32 healthy subjects randomized 3:1 toreceive a single subcutaneous administration of DX-2930 or placebo within 1 of 4 sequential, ascending dosecohorts (n = 8 each): 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg.
Results: No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Headache was the most commonly reported treatmentemergent adverse event (AE), occurring at a rate of 25{\%} in the DX-2930- and placebo-treated groups; nonewere severe and all resolved. There were no serious AEs, discontinuations owing to an AE, or deaths. Twosubjects had a severe AE reported as related to treatment by the blinded investigator; the 2 AEs wereasymptomatic creatinine phosphokinase elevations of 902 U/L in 1 subject receiving 0.1 mg/kg DX-2930 and1,967 U/L in 1 subject receiving placebo. For the 0.1-, 0.3-, 1.0-, and 3.0-mg/kg dose groups, respectively,mean maximum plasma concentrations were 0.6, 1.4, 5.6, and 14.5 mg/mL and mean elimination half-liveswere 20.6, 16.8, 17.6, and 21.2 days. Exploratory biomarker assays, involving ex vivo activation of the kallikreinpathway, showed dose- and time-dependent inhibition of plasma kallikrein, with evidence of sustainedbioactivity consistent with the pharmacokinetics profile.
Conclusion: A single administration of DX-2930 in healthy subjects up to doses of 3.0 mg/kg was welltolerated without dose-limiting toxicity. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data provide evidencefor a long-acting biological effect relevant to long-term prophylaxis for hereditary angioedema withC1-inhibitor deficiency.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01923207.},

Methods Japanese and matched Caucasian healthy subjects were enrolled into one of four cohorts and were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: 225, 675, or 900 mg fremanezumab, or placebo. Pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity sampling, and safety and tolerability assessments occurred at one inpatient visit and 12 ambulatory visits during the 36-week study. Results Pharmacokinetic analyses included those randomized to fremanezumab (n = 24 for each ethnic group) and safety analyses included all subjects enrolled in the study (n = 32 for each ethnic group). Fremanezumab concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters per dose were similar for Japanese and Caucasians at all dose levels. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for Cmax for Japanese to Caucasian subjects were 0.91, 1.04 and 1.14 for the 225 mg, 675 mg and 900 mg fremanezumab doses. GMRs for AUC0-inf were 0.96, 1.09, and 0.98, respectively. Median Tmax (range 5-11 days) and mean half-lives (range 31-39 days) were similar across doses for both ethnicities. Most frequently occurring adverse events were injection site reactions, abdominal pain, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation and nasopharyngitis. There was no development of anti-drug-antibodies and no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory findings. Conclusion The results of the pharmacokinetic exposure parameters and safety measures were similar for Japanese and Caucasians and support the once monthly and once quarterly sc injections of fremanezumab.},

abstract = {Subcutaneous delivery of biotherapeutics has become a valuable alternative to intravenous administration across many disease areas. Although the pharmacokinetic profiles of subcutaneous and intravenous formulations differ, subcutaneous administration has proven effective, safe, well-tolerated, generally preferred by patients and healthcare providers and to result in reduced drug delivery-related healthcare costs and resource use. The aim of this article is to discuss the differences between subcutaneous and intravenous dosing from both health-economic and scientific perspectives. The article covers different indications, treatment settings, administration volumes, and injection devices. We focus on biotherapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), immunoglobulin-replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency (PI), beta interferons in multiple sclerosis (MS), and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in oncology. While most subcutaneous biotherapeutics in RA, PI, and MS are self-administered at home, mAbs for oncology are still only approved for administration in a healthcare setting. Beside concerns around the safety of biotherapeutics in oncology, a key challenge for self-administration in this area is that doses and dosing volumes can be comparatively large; however, this difficulty has recently been overcome to some extent by the development of high-concentration solutions, the use of infusion pumps, and the coadministration of the dispersion enhancer hyaluronidase. Furthermore, given the increasing number of biotherapeutics being considered for combination therapy and the high dosing complexity associated with these, especially when administered intravenously, subcutaneous delivery of fixed-dose combinations might be an alternative that will diminish these burdens on healthcare systems.},

abstract = {AIM The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of denosumab (XGEVA{\textregistered}), a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody which binds to receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), for the treatment of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with advanced cancer and bone metastases. METHODS A total of 708 patients (116 healthy patients and 592 patients with solid tumours or multiple myeloma and bone metastases) included in seven clinical studies were evaluated for denosumab pharmacokinetics. Denosumab was administered as a single subcutaneous (s.c.) dose or multiple s.c. doses, ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 mg kg(-1) or 30 mg to 180 mg fixed dosing, every 1 or 3 months for up to 45 months. RESULTS Consistent with the results in healthy adults, single s.c. doses of denosumab demonstrated dose-dependent, non-linear pharmacokinetics in advanced cancer patients with bone metastases across a wide dose range (0.1-3.0 mg kg(-1) ). Reductions in levels of the bone turnover marker, uNTx/Cr, were observed within 1 day. The duration of reductions generally increased with dose and dosing frequency. In patients with solid tumours and bone metastases, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic comparisons across tumour types and concomitant cancer therapies (chemotherapies and/or hormone therapies) suggest that neither tumour type nor type of concomitant therapy markedly affects denosumab pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. CONCLUSIONS Denosumab displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics at doses below 60 mg but at higher doses, denosumab exposure increased approximately dose-proportionally in advanced cancer patients with bone metastases. Following a 120 mg, every 4 weeks dosing schedule, similar denosumab pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were observed across tumour types and were independent of concomitant cancer therapies.},

abstract = {Muromonab CD-3 (OKT-3) is a monoclonal antibody that is highly effective in the treatment of acute rejection in solid organ transplants. Due to its monoclonal nature, each molecule is identical because it is derived from a single antibody-producing clone. OKT-3 is administered only by intravenous injection and has a harmonic half-life of approximately 18 hours. It binds specifically to the CD-3 complex, which is involved in antigen recognition and cell stimulation, on the surface of T lymphocytes. Immediately after administration CD-3-positive T lymphocytes are abruptly removed from the circulation. The route of metabolism for OKT-3 is not clear; it may be removed by opsonization by the reticuloendothelial system when bound to T lymphocytes, or by human antimurine antibody production. The agent has been effective in reversing corticosteroid-resistant acute rejection in renal, liver, and cardiac transplant recipients. Its use in pancreatic and bone marrow recipients is inconclusive. OKT-3 has a considerable number of initial side effects, and some life-threatening reactions may occur. This drug should not be administered to any patient who is greater than 3{\%} usual body weight because of the potential for the development of severe pulmonary edema. OKT-3 may also be associated with a high rate of infection, especially of the viral type. The usual dose is 5 mg administered as an intravenous bolus over 2-4 minutes daily for 10-14 days. Approximately 85{\%} of patients treated with OKT-3 develop reactive human antimurine antibodies that, over time, may lead to tachyphylaxis and neutralization of the murine antibody OKT-3. OKT-3 is potent immunosuppressive agent and is an important prototype of future monoclonal antibodies.},

abstract = {Prediction of the plasma/serum mAb concentration–time profile in human is important to determine the required dose regime. This study proposes an approach for predicting the plasma/serum mAb concentration–time profile after intravenous and subcutaneous injection in human based on comprehensive analysis of reported pharmacokinetic data. Optimal scaling exponents from cynomolgus monkey to human for CL, Q, Vc, and Vp were estimated as 0.8, 0.75, 1.0, and 0.95, respectively. The estimated exponents were used to predict plasma/serum mAb concentration–time profile in human from pharmacokinetic data in cynomolgus monkey, and the results had reasonable accuracy with symmetric variability of prediction. Then, data reported for pharmacokinetics in human were used to estimate optimal ka and F after subcutaneous injection. The geometric mean of ka was suitable to predict Tmax, and F which was estimated from CL was suitable to predict Cmax. Our approach is useful for predicting the plasma/serum mAb concentration–time profile after intravenous and subcutaneous injection in human. Moreover, the study also investigated the possibility of predicting pharmacokinetic parameters of mAbs with increased FcRn binding mutations in human and found that our approach of prediction based on reported pharmacokinetic data may also be applicable to mAbs with these mutations.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the effect of dose, the anatomical site of injection, and the injection volume on subcutaneous absorption of rituximab in rats and to explore absorption mechanisms using pharmacokinetic modeling. METHODS: Rituximab serum concentrations were measured following intravenous and subcutaneous administration at the back, abdomen, and foot of rats. Several pharmacokinetic models were developed that included linear and saturable absorption, and degradation and/or protective binding at the injection site. RESULTS: Rituximab exhibited linear kinetics following intravenous administration; however, bioavailability following subcutaneous injection was inversely related to the dose level. For the 1 mg/kg dose, bioavailability was approximately 70{\%} at all tested injection sites, with faster absorption from the foot (T(max) = 12 h for foot vs. 4.6 days for back). Bioavailability for the 10 mg/kg dose was 44 and 31{\%} for the abdomen and back sites and 18{\%} for 40 mg/kg injected at the back. A pharmacokinetic model that included binding as part of the absorption mechanism successfully captured the nonlinearities in rituximab absorption. CONCLUSION: The anatomical site of subcutaneous injection influences the rate of absorption and bioavailability of rituximab in rats. Saturable binding may be a major determinant of the nonlinear absorptive transport of monoclonal antibodies.},

abstract = {Subcutaneous (SC) injection is becoming a more common route for the administration of biopharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no reliable in vitro method that can be used to anticipate the in vivo performance of a biopharmaceutical formulation intended for SC injection. Nor is there an animal model that can predict in vivo outcomes such as bioavailability in humans. We address this unmet need by the development of a novel in vitro system, termed Scissor (Subcutaneous Injection Site Simulator). The system models environmental changes that a biopharmaceutical could experience as it transitions from conditions of a drug product formulation to the homeostatic state of the hypodermis following SC injection. Scissor uses a dialysis-based injection chamber, which can incorporate various concentrations and combinations of acellular extracellular matrix (ECM) components that may affect the release of a biopharmaceutical from the SC injection site. This chamber is immersed in a container of a bicarbonate-based physiological buffer that mimics the SC injection site and the infinite sink of the body. Such an arrangement allows for real-time monitoring of the biopharmaceutical within the injection chamber, and can be used to characterize physicochemical changes of the drug and its interactions with ECM components. Movement of a biopharmaceutical from the injection chamber to the infinite sink compartment simulates the drug migration from the injection site and uptake by the blood and/or lymph capillaries. Here, we present an initial evaluation of the Scissor system using the ECM element hyaluronic acid and test formulations of insulin and four different monoclonal antibodies. Our findings suggest that Scissor can provide a tractable method to examine the potential fate of a biopharmaceutical formulation after its SC injection in humans and that this approach may provide a reliable and representative alternative to animal testing for the initial screening of SC formulations.},

abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are now more frequently administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection rather than intravenously, have become a tremendously successful drug format across a wide range of therapeutic areas. Preclinical evaluations of mAbs to be administered by SC injection are typically performed in species such as mice, rats, minipigs, and cynomolgus monkeys to obtain critical information regarding formulation performance and prediction of PK/PD outcomes needed to select clinical doses for first-in-human studies. Despite extensive efforts, no preclinical model has been identified to date that accurately predicts clinical outcomes for these SC injections. We have addressed this deficiency with a novel in vitro instrument, termed Scissor, to model events occurring at the SC injection site and now further validated this approach using a set of eight mAbs for which clinical PK/PD outcomes have been obtained. Diffusion of these mAbs from the Scissor system injection cartridge into a large volume physiological buffer, used to emulate mAb movement from the SC injection site into the systemic circulation, provided distinct profiles when monitored over a 6 h period. Curve-fitting analysis of these profiles using the Hill equation identified parameters that were used, along with physicochemical properties for each mAb, in a partial least squares analysis to define a relationship between molecule and formulation properties with clinical PK outcomes. The results demonstrate that parameters of protein charge at neutral pH and isoelectric point (pI) along with combined formulation properties such as viscosity and mAb concentration can dictate the movement of the mAb from the injection cartridge to infinite sink compartment. Examination of profile characteristics of this movement provided a strong predictive correlation for these eight mAbs. Together, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of this in vitro modelling strategy as a tool to identify drug and formulation properties that can define the performance of SC injected medicines and provide the potential for predicting clinical outcomes that could be useful for formulation selection and a first-in-human clinical dosing strategy.},

abstract = {A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model was developed to simultaneously characterize interferon after i.v. and s.c. dosing at various dose levels. A sequential study in monkeys (n = 18) was conducted, where single doses of 1, 3, and 10 MIU/kg of recombinant-human interferon-$\beta$ (IFN-$\beta$) 1a were given i.v. and then s.c. Plasma concentrations of IFN-$\beta$ were determined and biphasic neopterin concentrations were used as the pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint. Multiple dosing also was evaluated by giving 1 MIU/kg s.c. doses once daily for 7 days (n = 3). The integrated model uses target-mediated drug disposition to describe drug elimination by receptor binding and internalization, and well characterizes the observed non-linear pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. The s.c. doses exhibited an absorption phase (T max = 3 h) and incomplete bioavailability (F = 0.3-0.7). An indirect response model for stimulation of neopterin triphosphate production by activated receptor complex followed by conversion to neopterin was used to jointly model the formation and loss of neopterin with a capacity factor S max = 23.8. Greater relative neopterin response after s.c. dosing was accounted for by prolonged receptor activation relative to the SC 50 value. Repeated daily s.c. dosing produced modestly elevated IFN-$\beta$1a concentrations and neopterin concentrations that were lower than simulated from single-dose modeling. Although several mechanisms could be involved, these phenomena were simply remodeled as down-regulation of S max and receptors. The PK/PD model for IFN-$\beta$1a depicts receptor binding as a key feature controlling nonlinear elimination, nonstationary kinetics, and neopterin induction in a manner consistent with known processes controlling its disposition and pharmacological effects.},

Recent evidence also suggests that sc administration of protein therapeutics can increase tolerability to some treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin therapy by administering itsubcutaneously (subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy SCIG), which will reduce fluctuation in plasma drug concentration (Kobrynski L. 2012. Biologics 6:277-287). Furthermore, sc administration may reduce the risk of systemic infections associated with i.v. infusion (McDonald TA, Zepeda ML, Tomlinson MJ, Bee WH, Ivens IA. 2010. Curr Opin Mol Ther 12(4):461-470; Dychter SS, Gold DA, Haller MF. 2012. J Infus Nurs 35(3):154-160). This route, however, has its challenges, especially for large multidomain proteins. Poor bioavailability and poor scalability from preclinical models are often cited. This commentary will discuss barriers to sc absorption as well as physiological and experimental factors that could affect pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered large protein therapeutics in preclinical models. A mechanistic pharmacokinetic model is proposed as a potential tool to address the issue of scalability of sc pharmacokinetic from preclinical models to humans.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To review pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of antibodies that bind to soluble ligands within the framework of calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies. OVERVIEW: Calcitonin gene-related peptide has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Galcanezumab is an antibody that binds to the ligand calcitonin gene-related peptide. Other antibodies that target calcitonin gene-related peptide include eptinezumab and fremanezumab. To understand how antibodies can affect the extent and duration of free ligand concentrations, it is important to consider the dose and pharmacokinetics of an antibody, and the kinetics of the ligand and antibody-ligand complex. Insights regarding the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of galcanezumab as a probe antibody drug and calcitonin gene-related peptide as its binding ligand regarding its clinical outcomes are provided. DISCUSSION: Antibodies are administered parenterally because oral absorption is limited by gastrointestinal degradation and inefficient diffusion through the epithelium. The systemic absorption of antibodies following intramuscular or subcutaneous administration most likely occurs via convective transport through lymphatic vessels into blood. The majority of antibody elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism into peptides and amino acids following endocytosis. Binding of ligand to an antibody reduces the free ligand that is available to interact with the receptor and efficacy is driven by the magnitude and duration of the reduction in free ligand concentration. A galcanezumab pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model shows that galcanezumab decreases free calcitonin gene-related peptide concentrations in a dose- and time-dependent manner and continues to suppress free calcitonin gene-related peptide with repeated dosing. The model provides evidence for a mechanistic linkage to galcanezumab therapeutic effects for the preventive treatment of migraine.},

abstract = {The objectives of this retrospective analysis were (1) to characterize the population pharmacokinetics (popPK) of four different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a combined analysis of individual data collected during first-in-human (FIH) studies and (2) to provide a scientific rationale for prospective design of FIH studies with mAbs. The data set was composed of 171 subjects contributing a total of 2716 mAb serum concentrations, following intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) doses. mAb PK was described by an open 2-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment and a depot compartment with first-order absorption. Parameter values obtained from the popPK model were further used to generate optimal sampling times for a single dose study. A robust fit to the combined data from four mAbs was obtained using the 2-compartment model. Population parameter estimates for systemic clearance and central volume of distribution were 0.20 L/day and 3.6 L with intersubject variability of 31{\%} and 34{\%}, respectively. The random residual error was 14{\%}. Differences ({\textgreater} 2-fold) in PK parameters were not apparent across mAbs. Rich designs (22 samples/subject), minimal designs for popPK (5 samples/subject), and optimal designs for non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and popPK (10 samples/subject) were examined by stochastic simulation and estimation. Single-dose PK studies for linear mAbs executed using the optimal designs are expected to yield high-quality model estimates, and accurate capture of NCA estimations. This model-based meta-analysis has determined typical popPK values for four mAbs with linear elimination and enabled prospective optimization of FIH study designs, potentially improving the efficiency of FIH studies for this class of therapeutics.},

abstract = {The present review specifies the various chemical and physical factors that can influence drug stability and immunogenicity, and the treatment outcomes of antibody biologicals. Although monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are known to be more resistant to environmental changes compared with other proteins, the molecules themselves can be subjected to chemical and physical processes that promote their degradation and transformation into their specific amino‑acid moieties. With increasing use of medicinal products that contain mAbs, and their self‑administration by the patients, the issue of the correct manipulation of these drugs is of increasing importance. This review summarises the correct handling of mAb biologicals from the point of view of the pharmacist, clinical biochemist and patient, as is supported by relevant cases from the literature and our own data and experience. In particular, if there is a break in the cold chain, both healthcare professionals and patients need to be aware of the potential pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-dynamics alterations to these biologicals. Furthermore, any alterations in the protein structure can induce harmful immune reactions, including anaphylaxis and cytokine storms, or result in the production of neutralising or blocking Abs. Overall, considering also that treatment costs usually remain high, drug stability can have a tremendous effect on the clinical, human-istic and economic outcomes of such treatments.},

abstract = {Lowering the isoelectric point (pI) through engineering the variable region or framework of an IgG can improve its exposure and half-life via a reduction in clearance mediated through non-specific interactions. As such, net charge is a potentially important property to consider in developing therapeutic IgG molecules having favorable pharmaceutical characteristics. Frequently, it may not be possible to shift the pI of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) dramatically without the introduction of other liabilities such as increased off-target interactions or reduced on-target binding properties. In this report, we explored the influence of more subtle modifications of molecular charge on the in vivo properties of an IgG1 and IgG4 monoclonal antibody. Molecular surface modeling was used to direct residue substitutions in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to disrupt positive charge patch regions, resulting in a reduction in net positive charge without affecting the overall pI of the mAbs. The effect of balancing the net positive charge on non-specific binding was more significant for the IgG4 versus the IgG1 molecule that we examined. This differential effect was connected to the degree of influence on cellular degradation in vitro and in vivo clearance, distribution and metabolism in mice. In the more extreme case of the IgG4, balancing the charge yielded an ˜7-fold improvement in peripheral exposure, as well as significantly reduced tissue catabolism and subsequent excretion of proteolyzed products in urine. Balancing charge on the IgG1 molecule had a more subtle influence on non-specific binding and yielded only a modest alteration in clearance, distribution and elimination. These results suggest that balancing CDR charge without affecting the pI can lead to improved mAb pharmacokinetics, the magnitude of which is likely dependent on the relative influence of charge imbalance and other factors affecting the molecule's disposition.},

abstract = {Therapeutic mAbs must not only bind to their target but must also be free from “developability issues” such as poor stability or high levels of aggregation. While small-molecule drug discovery benefits from Lipinski's rule of five to guide the selection of molecules with appropriate biophysical properties, there is currently no in silico analog for antibody design. Here, we model the variable domain structures of a large set of post-phase-I clinical-stage antibody therapeutics (CSTs) and calculate in silico metrics to estimate their typical properties. In each case, we contextualize the CST distribution against a snapshot of the human antibody gene repertoire. We describe guideline values for five metrics thought to be implicated in poor developability: the total length of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), the extent and magnitude of surface hydrophobicity, positive charge and negative charge in the CDRs, and asymmetry in the net heavy- and light-chain surface charges. The guideline cutoffs for each property were derived from the values seen in CSTs, and a flagging system is proposed to identify nonconforming candidates. On two mAb drug discovery sets, we were able to selectively highlight sequences with developability issues. We make available the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP), a computational tool that builds downloadable homology models of variable domain sequences, tests them against our five developability guidelines, and reports potential sequence liabilities and canonical forms.

In this work, isoelectric points (pIs) of 23 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved mAbs were determined by imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (icIEF), and ranged from 6.1 to 9.4. The obtained values were in good agreement with those calculated by both Vector NTI and MassLynx softwares. icIEF can therefore be considered as a reference technique for such a determination. The relative percentages of acidic and basic variants determined by cation exchange chromatography (CEX) using both salt- and pH-gradients were comprised between 15{\%} and 30{\%} for most mAbs and were in good agreement with each other, whereas generic icIEF seems to overestimate the amount of acidic charge variants in mAb products. To our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the ionic properties of a wide range of FDA and EMA approved reference mAbs, using both generic chromatographic and electrophoretic methodologies. To illustrate the interest of the study for mAb developability purposes, ionic properties of a clinical mAb candidate (dalotuzumab) were also investigated.},

abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly being developed to treat multiple disease areas, including those related to oncology, immunology, neurology, and ophthalmology. There are multiple factors, such as charge, size, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding affinity, target affinity and biology, immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass, degree and type of glycosylation, injection route, and injection site, that could affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of these large macromolecular therapeutics, which in turn could have ramifications on their efficacy and safety. This minireview examines how characteristics of the antibodies could be altered to change their PK profiles. For example, it was observed that a net charge modification of at least a 1-unit shift in isoelectric point altered antibody clearance. Antibodies with enhanced affinity for FcRn at pH 6.0 display longer serum half-lives and slower clearances than wild type. Antibody fragments have different clearance rates and tissue distribution profiles than full length antibodies. Fc glycosylation is perceived to have a minimal effect on PK while that of terminal high mannose remains unclear. More investigation is warranted to determine if injection route and/or site impacts PK. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the effects of all these variations may allow for the better design of antibody therapeutics.},

abstract = {Background: Increased serum levels of antigen-specific IgE are often associated with allergic respiratory disorders. RhuMAb-E25, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, decreases free serum IgE by forming biologically inactive immune complexes with free IgE. Objective: We hypothesized that rhuMAb-E25 would decrease total serum IgE and reduce symptoms. Methods: Two hundred forty subjects were enrolled into five groups to determine the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of repeated administration of rhuMAb-E25 in adults with ragweed-induced allergic rhinitis and to explore the pharmacodynamic relationship of rhuMAb-E25 and IgE. One hundred eighty- one subjects received an initial intravenous loading dose (day 0. 1 month before ragweed season), followed by administration of rhuMAb-E25 (in mg/kg body weight) of 0.15 mg/kg subcutaneously, 0.15 mg/kg intravenously, or 0.5 mg/kg intravenously on days 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84. A subcutaneous placebo group and an intravenous placebo group were included. The total evaluation time included the 84-day treatment period, followed by a 42-day observation period. Results: Adverse events were mild, and no differences were observed in the rates between the three active and two placebo treatment groups. Ragweed-specific IgE levels correlated with symptom scores. RhuMAb- E25 decreased serum free IgE levels in a dose- and baseline IgE-dependent fashion. However, only 11 subjects had IgE levels that were suppressed to undetectable levels (≤24 ng/ml), a sample too small to demonstrate significant differences and clinical efficacy. Thus the case for efficacy was not proven. Nonetheless, the study confirms that it is safe to repeatedly administer rhuMAb-E25 over a period of months. Conclusions: Because rhuMAb- E25 decreased serum free IgE in a dose-dependent fashion and because symptom scores correlated with antigen-specific IgE levels, the results suggest that if given in adequate doses, rhuMAb-E25 should be an effective therapy for allergic diseases.},

The consequences of readministering omalizulab after a lapse of time have also been studied. These studies have confirmed that serum-free IgE declines in a dose-related manner with such treatment and that omalizumab-induced declines in IgE correlate with symptom improvement. Whether omalizumab is administered intravenously or subcutaneously, its pharmacokinetics do not differ. A Phase II dose-ranging study demonstrated that the optimum efficacious dose of omalizumab for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis is 300 mg administered subcutaneously. The dosing frequency, in terms of whether the antibody is administered every 3 or 4 wk, is based on the patient's baseline IgE level. With adequate dosing, nasal and ocular symptoms are significantly reduced, and quality of life is significantly improved. Omalizumab is safe and well tolerated and can be safely readministered in subsequent pollen seasons.},

METHODS: This was a double-blind, three-arm, parallel-group study (EudraCT number: 2013-003173-10). Healthy subjects received single doses (5 mg/kg) of CT-P13 (n = 71), EU-RMP (n = 71) or US-RMP (n = 71). The primary objective was to compare the PK profiles for the three formulations. Assessments of comparative safety and tolerability were secondary objectives.

RESULTS: Baseline demographics were well balanced across the three groups. Primary end points (Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf) were equivalent between all formulations (CT-P13 vs EU-RMP; CT-P13 vs US-RMP; EU-RMP vs US-RMP). All other PK end points supported the high similarity of the three treatments. Tolerability profiles of the formulations were similar.

CONCLUSION: The PK profile of CT-P13 is highly similar to EU-RMP and US-RMP. All three formulations were equally well tolerated.},

The therapeutic success of biologics targeting tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin (IL)-6 receptor (IL-6R) has broadened the treatment options for RA. These agents have potential overlapping and discriminating biologic effects, as well as different pharmacological features. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes IL-6R, resulting in the inhibition of various IL-6-mediated biological activities, including inflammation-related, immunomodulatory and tissue/matrix remodelling effects. Randomized, double-blind, controlled phase III studies and a number of early clinical observational studies have shown that treatment with TCZ results in rapid and sustained improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA among different patient populations. These studies have established the efficacy and safety of TCZ. Here, we review the pleiotropic functions of IL-6 and how it impinges on many aspects of RA pathogenesis, and highlight the clinical experience to date with TCZ as an emerging new treatment option for RA.},

Methods: In this open-label, parallel-group study, adult atopic subjects (serum immunoglobulin [Ig] E 30-300 IU/ ml; body weight, 40-90 kg) received a single subcutaneous dose (150 or 300 mg) of solution or powder omalizumab. Serum concentrations of total omalizumab, free and total IgE and safety were determined up to 84 days post dose. Bioequivalence was examined for dose-normalized parameters of omalizumab in serum: maximum concentration (C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}max{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}), area under the concentration-time curve up to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0-tlast{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) and up to infinity (AUC{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0-inf{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90{\%} confidence interval (CI) of the ratio of solution vs. powder geometric means was entirely contained within 0.8-1.25. Results: 155 subjects were randomized and dosed (62.6{\%} female; mean age, 34.7 years). Systemic exposure to omalizumab was similar for the two formulations at both doses. PK bioequivalence was demonstrated (n = 153): C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}max{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, ratio of geometric means: 1.01 (90{\%} CI: 0.95-1.08); AUC{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0-tlast{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, 0.98 (0.92-1.05); AUC{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0-inf{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, 0.98 (0.91-1.05). Omalizumab mean elimination half-life: 22.1 days for solution; 22.9 days for powder. PD parameters (n = 154) of free and total IgE in serum were comparable between formulations; each produced a 95{\%} reduction from screening in free IgE. Most common adverse events (AEs): headache (23.9{\%}), sinus congestion (8.4{\%}). No serious AEs were reported.

abstract = {Model-informed drug discovery and development (MID3) is an umbrella term under which sit several computational approaches: quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP), quantitative systems toxicology (QST) and physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK). QSP models are built using mechanistic knowledge of the pharmacological pathway focusing on the putative mechanism of drug efficacy; whereas QST models focus on safety and toxicity issues and the molecular pathways and networks that drive these adverse effects. These can be mediated through exaggerated on-target or off-target pharmacology, immunogenicity or the physiochemical nature of the compound. PBPK models provide a mechanistic description of individual organs and tissues to allow the prediction of the intra- and extra-cellular concentration of the parent drug and metabolites under different conditions. Information on biophase concentration enables the prediction of a drug effect in different organs and assessment of the potential for drug–drug interactions. Together, these modelling approaches can inform the exposure–response relationship and hence support hypothesis generation and testing, compound selection, hazard identification and risk assessment through to clinical proof of concept (POC) and beyond to the market. Used in combination, physiologically based pharmacokinetics, quantitative systems pharmacology and quantitative systems toxicology have the potential to improve prediction of the effective drug concentration and the associated beneficial and adverse effects, improving the chances of success in biopharma R{\&}D.},

abstract = {Recent research indicates that the pathophysiology of breast-cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is more complex than simple axillary lymphatic obstruction as a result of the cancer treatment. Uneven distribution of swelling (involvement of the mid-arm region is common, but the hand is often spared) is puzzling. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that local differences in lymphatic drainage contribute to the regionality of the oedema. Using lymphoscintigraphy, we measured the removal rate constant, k (representing local lymph flow per unit distribution volume, VD), for 99mTc-labelled human immunoglobulin G in the oedematous proximal forearm, and in the hand (finger web) in women in whom the hand was unaffected. Tracer was injected subcutaneously, and the depot plus the rest of the arm was monitored with a gamma-radiation camera for up to 6 h. VD was assessed from image width. Contralateral arms served as controls. k was 25{\%} lower in oedematous forearm tissue than in the control arm (BCRL, -0.070+/-0.026{\%} x min(-1); control, -0.093+/-0.028{\%} x min(-1); mean+/-S.D.; P=0.012) and VD was greater. In the non-oedematous hand of the BCRL arm, k was 18{\%} higher than in the control hand (BCRL, -0.110+/-0.027{\%} x min(-1); control, -0.095+/-0.028{\%} x min(-1); P=0.057) and 59{\%} higher than forearm k on the BCRL side (P=0.0014). VD did not differ between the hands. Images of the BCRL arm following hand injection showed diffuse activity in the superficial tissues, sometimes extending almost to the shoulder. A possible interpretation is that the hand is spared in some patients because local lymph flow is increased and diverted along collateral dermal routes. The results support the hypothesis that regional differences in surviving lymphatic function contribute to the distribution of swelling.},

abstract = {In BCRL (breast cancer-related lymphoedema), arm swelling is unevenly distributed and some regions are partly or entirely spared. In particular, the hand may or not be swollen, but when involved functional impairment can be substantial. We have found previously that, when the ipsilateral hand is spared of swelling (in a limb with swelling proximal to the hand), the local lymph drainage rate constant (k) is at least as high as in the contralateral hand, contrary to the traditional 'stopcock' concept of reduced lymph drainage from the whole limb. In the light of this finding, we have investigated lymph drainage in the hands of eight women with BCRL and moderate-to-severe hand swelling, using gamma-camera quantitative lymphoscintigraphy. Images showed pronounced superficial activity in the ipsilateral swollen arms of most patients, indicating dermal backflow. k for 99mTc-labelled hIgG (human IgG) measured over 5 h in the subcutis of the ipsilateral swollen hand was 34+/-24{\%} less than in the contralateral hand (P=0.013). Activity measured in the ipsilateral swollen forearm increased progressively, but there was very little increase in the contralateral forearm, indicating retention of 99mTc-labelled hIgG in the swollen forearm. It is concluded that lymphatic function in the swollen hand is impaired, and that there appears to be two populations of women with BCRL, i.e. spared-hand and swollen-hand, irrespective of the cancer treatment received.},

We explored these properties by observing correlations of up to 60 different antibodies of the IgG1 isotype. Unexpectedly, we observe significant correlations with simple physical properties obtainable from antibody sequences and by molecular dynamics simulations of individual antibody molecules. mAbs viscosities increase strongly with hydrophobicity and charge dipole distribution and decrease with net charge. Fast clearance correlates with high hydrophobicities of certain complementarity determining regions and with high positive or high negative net charge. Chemical degradation from tryptophan oxidation correlates with the average solvent exposure time of tryptophan residues. Aspartic acid isomerization rates can be predicted from solvent exposure and flexibility as determined by molecular dynamics simulations.

abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) play an increasing important role in the therapeutic armamentarium against multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory and degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Most of the mAbs currently developed for MS are immunomodulators blocking the inflammatory immune process. In contrast with mAbs targeting immune function, GNbAC1, a humanized IgG4 mAb, targets the multiple sclerosis associated retrovirus envelope (MSRV-Env) protein, an upstream factor in the pathophysiology of MS. MSRV-Env protein is of endogenous retroviral origin, expressed in MS brain lesions, and it is pro-inflammatory and toxic to the remyelination process, by preventing the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. We present the preclinical and early clinical development results of GNbAC1. The specificity of GNbAC1 for its endogenous retroviral target is described. Efficacy of different mAb versions of GNbAC1 were assessed in MSRV-Env induced experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Because the target MSRV-Env is not expressed in animals, no relevant animal model exists for a proper in vivo toxicological program. An off-target 2-week toxicity study in mice was thus performed, and it showed an absence of safety risk. Additional in vitro analyses showed an absence of complement or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity as well as a low level of cross-reactivity to human tissues. The first-in-man clinical study in 33 healthy subjects and a long-term clinical study in 10 MS patients showed that GNbAC1 is well tolerated in humans without induction of immunogenicity and that it induces a pharmacodynamic response on MSRV biomarkers. These initial results suggest that the mAb GNbAC1 could be a safe long-term treatment for patients with MS with a unique therapeutic mechanism of action.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). Abstract: Rituximab (MabThera {\textregistered} /Rituxan {\textregistered} ), a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen CD20, was the first therapeutic antibody to enter clinical practice for the treatment of cancer. As monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, rituximab has been shown to prolong progression-free survival and, in some indications overall survival, in patients with various B-cell malignancies, while having a well-established and manageable safety profile and a wide therapeutic window. As a result, rituximab is considered to have revolutionized treatment practices for patients with B-cell malignancies. A subcutaneous (SC) formulation of rituximab has been developed, comprising the same monoclonal antibody as the originally marketed formulation [rituximab concentrate for solution for intravenous (IV) infusion], and has undergone a detailed, sequential clinical development program. This program demonstrated that, at fixed doses, rituximab SC achieves non-inferior serum trough concentrations in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, with comparable efficacy and safety relative to the IV formulation. The added benefit of rituximab SC was demonstrated in dedicated studies showing that rituximab SC allows for simplified and shortened drug preparation and administration times resulting in a reduced treatment burden for patients as well as improved resource utilization (efficiency) at the treatment facility. The improved efficiency of delivering rituximab's benefit to patients may broaden patient access to rituximab therapy in areas with low levels of healthcare resources, including IV-chair capacity constraints.

@article{Rippe1994,
abstract = {In this review we summarized the evidence favoring the concept that the major plasma proteins are passively transported across vascular walls through water-filled pathways by means of convection and diffusion. With regard to solute transport, a majority of microvascular walls seems to show a bimodal size selectivity. This implies the presence of a high frequency of functional small pores, restricting proteins, and an extremely low number of non-size-selective pathways, permitting the passage of macromolecules from blood to tissue, here denoted large pores. We discussed the general behavior of such a heteroporous system. A major consequence of two-pore heteroporosity is that large-solute transport must mainly occur due to convection through large pores at low filtration rates, that is, at normal or even zero lymph flows. Indeed, convection must be the predominating transport mode for most solutes across large pores when the net filtration rate is zero. Under these (transient) conditions, the convective leak of macromolecules across large pores will be counterbalanced by absorption of essentially protein-free fluid through protein-restrictive pores. In a heteroporous membrane, proteins can thus be transported by solvent drag across vascular walls in the absence of a net convection. Normally the steady-state transcapillary fluid flow (lymph flow) is about equally partitioned among small and large pores, which makes lymph essentially a "half and half" mixture of protein-free ultrafiltrate and plasma. With increasing fluid flows, however, the plasma filtrate will be progressively diluted, eventually reaching a protein concentration largely in proportion to the fractional hydraulic conductance accounted for by the large pores (alpha L). Under these high lymph flow conditions, not only the large-pore transport but also the small-pore transport (of smaller macromolecules) will become convective. At low lymph flows, however, the small-pore transport of smaller macromolecules is usually mostly diffusive. An important implication of capillary heteroporosity is that single-pore formalism is inadequate for correctly evaluating the capillary sieving characteristics. With the use of homoporous transport formalism, the "lumped" macromolecular PS and sigma will therefore vary as a function of transcapillary fluid flow (Jv). However, it is approximately correct to use single-pore formalism for conditions when Jv is very high during steady state. Thus, if minimal sieving coefficients can be measured for macromolecules, then these values will accurately reflect (1 - sigma).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Treating the blood-tissue barrier as a two-pore membrane the separate fluid and solute fluxes occurring across 'small pores' and 'large pores' were modelled in continuous capillaries employing two-pore equations for the calculations together with the non-linear flux equation and theories for restricted diffusion and for the reflection coefficient (sigma). The two-pore equations derived proved useful for analyses of transvascular protein flux data obtained at low as well as at high filtration rates. These equations were applied to lymphatic protein flux data from dog paw (Renkin et al. 1977a, b) and to tracer albumin uptake data from rat skeletal muscle (Rippe et al. 1979). For both sets of data the small- and large-pore radii became closely similar, 44 vs. 45 A and 240 vs. 225 A, which also holds for the large-pore fractions of hydraulic conductivity (0.097 vs. 0.056). The main result of this analysis is that the passage of macromolecules normally occurring across the microvascular walls is almost entirely convective, and hence, dependent on the transmural hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients and on the hydraulic conductivity. For example, 75-90{\%} of the transvascular passage of albumin was found to be due to convection through large pores at normal lymph flows, the remaining portion being mainly due to diffusion across small pores. Solutes larger than albumin were almost exclusively transported by convection across large pores. Two-pore heterogeneity was found to explain the previously observed variations of the apparent overall large solute diffusion capacity (PSapp) and the overall reflection coefficient (sigma f) with filtration rate and also previous overestimations of PS. Furthermore, the present results were not compatible with protein transport across any 'non-hydraulically conductive capillary pathways' as previously postulated from the lymphatic protein flux data analysed here (Renkin 1985).},

The model system analyzed is (solution, homogeneous membrane 1, solution, homogeneous membrane 2, solution), where the two homogeneous membranes have different parameters. An active transport mechanism for solute is also included as a part of membrane 1. A variety of qualitative properties of the system are derived for two special cases. In case I (pure active transport) the concentrations in the outer solutions are the same and the solute pump is functioning. In case II (pure osmotic flow) the concentrations in the outer solutions are different and the solute pump is inactive. For case I, one of the results is that there will be solution flow across the system, which may be hypertonic, isotonic, or hypotonic. It is also possible to have solvent flow with no net solute flow. For case II, a result is that the solvent flow is not linearly related to the concentration difference between the outer solutions. Furthermore, the system will exhibit rectification of solute and solvent flow. Possible applications of this model to biological systems are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1963.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate Taylor dispersion analysis (TDA) as a novel method for determination of hydrodynamic radius of therapeutic peptides and proteins in non-stressed and stressed formulations and to compare it with dynamic light scattering (DLS).  METHODS: The hydrodynamic radius of oxytocin, bovine serum albumin, various monoclonal antibodies (type IgG) and etanercept at concentrations between 0.05 and 50 mg/ml was determined by TDA and DLS. IgGs and etanercept were stressed (elevated temperatures) and analyzed by TDA, DLS and HP-SEC.  RESULTS: TDA and DLS were comparable in sizing non-stressed peptides and proteins in a concentration range of about 0.5 to 50 mg/ml. TDA performed well even at lower concentrations, where DLS tends to provide theoretically high values of the Z-average radius. However, because of differences in the detection physics, DLS was more weighted towards the detection of aggregates in stressed formulations than TDA. Advantageously, TDA was also able to size the small peptide oxytocin, which was not feasible by DLS.  CONCLUSION: TDA allows the accurate determination of the hydrodynamic radius of peptides and proteins over a wide concentration range, with little interference from excipients present in the sample. It is marginally less sensitive than DLS in detecting size increase for stressed protein samples.},

Nine normal men had an average interstitial fluid albumin concentration (Ci) of 2.92 g/100 ml (S.D. 0.32) and a ratio between interstitial albumin concentration and serum albumin concentration (Ci/Cs) of 0.62 (S.D. 0.09). The corresponding values for IgG were 0.65 g/100 ml (S.D. 0.18) and 0.52 (S.D. 0.12) respectively. Evidence is presented showing that subcutaneous interstitial fluid may be representative of interstitial fluid in the whole body with regard to the concentrations of the two proteins. The microvascular permeability in subcutis is greater for albumin than for IgG, the subcutis being perhaps a little more permeable to IgG relative to albumin than the average total body.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) metabolism has received much attention in the literature for two reasons: (i) IgG homeostasis is regulated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), by a pH-dependent and saturable recycling process, which presents an interesting biological system; (ii) the IgG-FcRn interaction may be exploitable as a means for extending the plasma half-life of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, which are primarily IgG-based. A less-studied problem is the importance of endogenous IgG metabolism in IgG multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma, quantification of serum monoclonal immunoglobulin plays an important role in diagnosis, monitoring and response assessment. In order to investigate the dynamics of IgG in this setting, a mathematical model characterizing the metabolism of endogenous IgG in humans is required. A number of authors have proposed a two-compartment nonlinear model of IgG metabolism in which saturable recycling is described using Michaelis-Menten kinetics; however it may be difficult to estimate the model parameters from the limited experimental data that are available. The purpose of this study is to analyse the model alongside the available data from experiments in humans and estimate the model parameters. In order to achieve this aim we linearize the model and use several methods of model and parameter validation: stability analysis, structural identifiability analysis, and sensitivity analysis based on traditional sensitivity functions and generalized sensitivity functions. We find that all model parameters are identifiable, structurally and taking into accou nt parameter correlations, when several types of model output are used for parameter estimation. Based on these analyses we estimate parameter values from the limited available data and compare them with previously published parameter values. Finally we show how the model can be applied in future studies of treatment effectiveness in IgG multiple myeloma with simulations of serum monoclonal IgG responses during treatment.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models provide a rational mechanistic approach for predicting the time course of macromolecules in plasma. Population PBPK models for large molecules necessitate incorporation of lymphatic circulation to mechanistically account for biodistribution. Moreover, characterization of subcutaneous absorption requires consideration of the microvascular transit from the injection site to the systemic circulation. A PBPK model for a pegylated peptide conjugate, previously developed for primates, was modified to describe the lymphatic uptake in a population of humans by incorporation of interindividual variability in the lymphatic circulation and a unique lymphatic drainage compartment (LDC). The model was then used to simulate the time course of the drug in a population of humans and compared to the same drug administered to a group of human subjects participating in a first-in-human study. METHODS Organ, blood and lymph masses for the population were sampled from either normal or log-normal distributions. Blood flows were calculated for each organ based on mean organ perfusion per gram of organ tissue and lymphatic flow was set as a fixed fraction of blood flow. Interindividual variability in lymphatic volume was assumed to be similar to that of blood volume. The volume of the LDC was parameterzed as a fraction of the injection volume. Sensitivity analysis was performed to study uncertain parameters and distribution assumptions. RESULTS The population generator was capable of simulating a virtual population incorporating the lymphatic circulation. Incorporation of a LDC resulted in similar line shape relative to the observed data and incorporation of anthropometric variability accounted for individual differences in the absorption and elimination phases across all dose cohorts. Line shape was sensitive to the inclusion of LDC while peak and elimination portions of the time course were influenced by the magnitude of variance assumed for blood volume and renal clearance, respectively. CONCLUSION Lymphatic circulation can be incorporated into a population PBPK model assuming similar interindividual variability as observed for blood volume. Incorporation of an LDC, where the volume of this transit compartment is proportional to the SC injection volume may be an important mechanistic means of predicting the transit from the SC depot to the systemic circulation.},

However, little is known about whether FcRn is functionally expressed in immune cells. We show here that FcRn mRNA was identifiable in human monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. FcRn heavy chain was detectable as a 45-kDa protein in monocytic U937 and THP-1 cells and in purified human intestinal macrophages, peripheral blood monocytes, and dendritic cells by Western blot analysis. FcRn colocalized in vivo with macrosialin (CD68) and Ncl-Macro, two macrophage markers, in the lamina propria of human small intestine. The heavy chain of FcRn was associated with the beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) light chain in U937 and THP-1 cells. FcRn bound human IgG at pH 6.0, but not at pH 7.5. This binding could be inhibited by human IgG Fc, but not Fab. FcRn could be detected on the cell surface of activated, but not resting, THP-1 cells. Furthermore, FcRn was uniformly present intracellularly in all blood monocytes and intestinal macrophages. FcRn was detectable on the cell surface of a significant fraction of monocytes at lower levels and on a small subset of tissue macrophages that expressed high levels of FcRn on the cell surface. These data show that FcRn is functionally expressed and its cellular distribution is regulated in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, suggesting that it may confer novel IgG binding functions upon these cell types relative to typical Fc gamma Rs: Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII.},

In addition, FcRn plays an important role in immunity at mucosal and systemic sites through its ability to affect the lifespan of IgG, as well as its participation in innate and adaptive immune responses. Although the details of its biology are still emerging, the ability of FcRn to rescue albumin and IgG from early degradation represents an attractive approach to alter the plasma half-life of pharmaceuticals.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) metabolism has received much attention in the literature for two reasons: (i) IgG homeostasis is regulated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), by a pH-dependent and saturable recycling process, which presents an interesting biological system; (ii) the IgG-FcRn interaction may be exploitable as a means for extending the plasma half-life of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, which are primarily IgG-based. A less-studied problem is the importance of endogenous IgG metabolism in IgG multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma, quantification of serum monoclonal immunoglobulin plays an important role in diagnosis, monitoring and response assessment. In order to investigate the dynamics of IgG in this setting, a mathematical model characterizing the metabolism of endogenous IgG in humans is required. A number of authors have proposed a two-compartment nonlinear model of IgG metabolism in which saturable recycling is described using Michaelis-Menten kinetics; however it may be difficult to estimate the model parameters from the limited experimental data that are available. The purpose of this study is to analyse the model alongside the available data from experiments in humans and estimate the model parameters. In order to achieve this aim we linearize the model and use several methods of model and parameter validation: stability analysis, structural identifiability analysis, and sensitivity analysis based on traditional sensitivity functions and generalized sensitivity functions. We find that all model parameters are identifiable, structurally and taking into accou nt parameter correlations, when several types of model output are used for parameter estimation. Based on these analyses we estimate parameter values from the limited available data and compare them with previously published parameter values. Finally we show how the model can be applied in future studies of treatment effectiveness in IgG multiple myeloma with simulations of serum monoclonal IgG responses during treatment.},

abstract = {Pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies characterize some human autoimmune diseases; their high concentration and long half-life are dependent on recycling by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Inhibition of FcRn is an attractive new treatment concept for IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Rozanolixizumab (UCB7665; CA170-01519.g57 IgG4P) is an anti-human FcRn monoclonal antibody. In cynomolgus monkeys, rozanolixizumab reduced IgG (maximum 75 to 90{\%} by about day 10), was well tolerated, and did not increase risk of infection. We also report a first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, dose-escalating study of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) rozanolixizumab in healthy subjects (NCT02220153). The primary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives were assessment of rozanolixizumab pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including effects on circulating IgG concentrations. Forty-nine subjects were randomized to receive rozanolixizumab (n = 36) or placebo (n = 13) across six cohorts. The first three cohorts received IV doses, and the subsequent three cohorts received SC doses, of rozanolixizumab 1, 4, or 7 mg/kg (n = 6 for each cohort; plus n = 7 or 6 for placebo, respectively). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse event [TEAE; headache, 14 of 36 (38.9{\%}) subjects] was dose-dependent and more prominent after IV administration. Severe TEAEs occurred in four subjects, all in the highest-dose IV group [headache (n = 3) and back pain (n = 1)]. Rozanolixizumab pharmacokinetics demonstrated nonlinear increases with dose. There were sustained dose-dependent reductions in serum IgG concentrations (IV and SC rozanolixizumab). These data provide clinical evidence for the therapeutic potential of rozanolixizumab.},

abstract = {Immunoglobulins are molecules produced by activated B cells and plasma cells in response to exposure to antigens. Upon antigen exposure, these molecules are secreted allowing the immune system to recognize and effectively respond to a myriad of pathogens. Immunoglobulin or antibody secreting cells are the mature form of B lymphocytes, which during their development undergo gene rearrangements and selection in the bone marrow ultimately leading to the generation of B cells, each expressing a single antigen-specific receptor/immunoglobulin molecule. Each individual immunoglobulin molecule has an affinity for a unique motif, or epitope, found on a given antigen. When presented with an antigen, activated B cells differentiate into either plasma cells (which secrete large amounts of antibody that is specific for the inducing antigen), or memory B cells (which are long-lived and elicit a stronger and faster response if the host is re-exposed to the same antigen). The secreted form of immunoglobulin, when bound to an antigen, serves as an effector molecule that directs other cells of the immune system to facilitate the neutralization of soluble antigen or the eradication of the antigen-expressing pathogen. This review will focus on the regulation of secreted immunoglobulin by long-lived normal or disease-associated plasma cells. Specifically, the focus will be on signaling and transcriptional events that regulate the development and homeostasis of long-lived immunoglobulin secreting plasma cells.},

abstract = {Exposure of Ab-secreting cells to selected hormones, cytokines, and drugs alters the rate of Ig production in vitro. Whether these effects are important clinically is unknown because there are no safe, reproducible, and appropriate techniques for measuring Ig synthesis in vivo. We developed a stable isotope tracer method to measure IgG secretion into plasma. L-[1-13C]Leucine was given as a priming dose followed by a constant i.v. infusion over 8 h. Tracer accrual in IgG, determined by mass spectrometry, was linear from 2 to 8 h of the infusion. The normal rate of IgG synthesis into plasma assessed in 21 healthy subjects was 860 +/- 310 mg/day (mean +/- SD). The synthetic rate measurements were remarkably reproducible (coefficient of variation = 10.5 {\%}). Simultaneous analysis of leucine kinetics allows, for the first time, Ig secretion to be studied in the context of whole body protein economy. IgG secretion into plasma accounts for 0.3{\%} of whole body protein synthesis. Experimental support for a key metabolic assumption, that tracer enrichment in plasma and that at the site of IgG synthesis were similar, came from a comparison of synthetic rates derived from low dose and high dose tracer infusions. Measurement of Ig secretion by tracer incorporation is rapid and reproducible. In contrast to older methods that rely on radioisotope disappearance, the tracer incorporation method is safe for serial measurements in an individual and will be useful for quantitative studies of treatment effects and immune regulation in vivo.},

Additionally, FcRn turnover was evaluated via pulse-chase. FcRn mRNA expression was significantly higher in transgenic mice when compared to mouse FcRn mRNA in Swiss Webster mice and it ranged from 184-fold higher in the kidney to 109,000-fold higher in the skin. FcRn protein expression was found to be 13-fold lower in kidney to 5.6-fold higher in lung obtained from transgenic mice compared to FcRn protein expression in lung samples obtained from Swiss Webster mice. FcRn protein expression in human liver and small intestine tissues matched more closely with FcRn expression in Swiss Webster mice but were significantly lower when compared to values found from Swiss Webster and transgenic mice. Although FcRn mRNA expression correlated significantly with protein expression (p {\textless} 0.0005), the correlation coefficient was only 0.113. As such, the measurement of FcRn protein may be preferred to FcRn mRNA for quantitative applications. Significant differences were found in FcRn expression in transgenic mice, Swiss Webster mice, and human tissues, which may have implications for the use of mouse models in the assessment of monoclonal antibody disposition, efficacy, and safety.},

abstract = {The endosomal-lysosomal system is made up of a set of intracellular membranous compartments that dynamically interconvert, which is comprised of early endosomes, recycling endosomes, late endosomes, and the lysosome. In addition, autophagosomes execute autophagy, which delivers intracellular contents to the lysosome. Maturation of endosomes and/or autophagosomes into a lysosome creates an unique acidic environment within the cell for proteolysis and recycling of unneeded cellular components into usable amino acids and other biomolecular building blocks. In the endocytic pathway, gradual maturation of endosomes into a lysosome and acidification of the late endosome are accompanied by vesicle trafficking, protein sorting and targeted degradation of some sorted cargo. Two opposing sorting systems are operating in these processes: the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) supports targeted degradation and the retromer supports retrograde retrieval of certain cargo. The endosomal-lysosomal system is emerging as a central player in a host of neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating potential roles which are likely to be revealed in pathogenesis and for viable therapeutic strategies. Here we focus on the physiological process of endosomal-lysosomal maturation, acidification and sorting systems along the endocytic pathway, and further discuss relationships between abnormalities in the endosomal-lysosomal system and neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD).},

abstract = {Recently, our laboratory reported that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment increased antiplatelet antibody (7E3) clearance in a rat model of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). However, due to the multifaceted nature of IVIG therapy, the contribution of this increase in antiplatelet antibody clearance to the total therapeutic effect of IVIG was unclear. The purposes of the present study were to (1). develop a new, mechanistic model of immune gamma globulin (IgG) pharmacokinetics, (2). develop a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model relating 7E3 concentrations to the platelet count time course observed following 7E3 treatment, and (3). use these mathematical models to gain insight into the significance of increased 7E3 clearance relative to the total effect of IVIG on 7E3-induced thrombocytopenia. A mechanism-based PK model was developed that adequately characterized IVIG effects on 7E3 pharmacokinetics. The structure of this model is based on competition between IgG molecules for occupancy of the protective FcRn receptor. The model accurately captured antiplatelet antibody concentration versus time data in the presence and absence of IVIG therapy, in the rat, in 'wild-type' mice, and in 'knockout' mice lacking expression of the FcRn receptor. An indirect response PK/PD model was also developed, which accurately characterized 7E3 effects on platelet counts. Using these models, it was estimated that 50 +/- 11{\%} of the total protective effect of IVIG in this acute model of ITP can be accounted for by IVIG effects on 7E3 disposition.},

abstract = {Domain antibodies (dAbs) are the smallest antigen-binding fragments of immunoglobulins. To date, there is limited insight into the pharmacokinetics of dAbs, especially their distribution into tissues and elimination. The objective of this work was to develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model to investigate the biodisposition of a non-specific dAb construct in mice. Following a single IV administration of 10 mg/kg dummy dAb protein to twenty four female mice, frequent blood samples were collected and whole body lateral sections were analyzed by quantitative whole-body autoradiography. The model is based on the two-pore hypothesis of extravasation where organ-specific isogravimetric flow rates (J(org,ISO)) and permeability-surface area products (PSorg) are expressed as linear functions of the lymph flow rate (J(org)) and the kidney compartment is modified to account for glomerular filtration of dAb. As a result, only J(org), glomerular filtration coefficient and the combined volume of Bowman's capsule, proximal and distal renal tubules and loop of Henle were optimized by fitting simultaneously all blood and organ data to the model. Our model captures the pharmacokinetic profiles of dAb in blood and all organs and shows that extravasation into interstitial space is a predominantly diffusion-driven process. The parameter values were estimated with good precision ({\%}RMSE a parts per thousand 30) and low cross-correlation (R-2 {\textless} 0.2). We developed a flexible model with a limited parameter number that may be applied to other biotherapeutics after adapting for size-related effects on extravasation and renal elimination processes.},

Inter-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is generally moderate to high; however, the factors responsible for the high inter-subject variability have not been comprehensively reviewed. In this review, the extent of inter-subject variability for mAb pharmacokinetics is presented and potential factors contributing to this variability are explored and summarised. Disease status, age, sex, ethnicity, body size, genetic polymorphisms, concomitant medication, co-morbidities, immune status and multiple other patient-specific details have been considered. The inter-subject variability for mAb pharmacokinetics most likely depends on the complex interplay of multiple factors. However, studies aimed at investigating the reasons for the inter-subject variability are sparse. Population pharmacokinetic models and physiologically based pharmacokinetic models are useful tools to identify important covariates, aiding in the understanding of factors contributing to inter-subject variability.

abstract = {In this work we proposed a population physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (popPBPK) framework for quantifying and predicting inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability using the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab as an example. First, a PBPK model was developed to account for the possible mechanistic sources of variability. Within the model, five key factors that contribute to variability were identified and the nature of their contribution was quantified with local and global sensitivity analyses. The five key factors were the concentration of membrane-bound HER2 (), the convective flow rate of mAb through vascular pores (), the endocytic transport rate of mAb through vascular endothelium (), the degradation rate of mAb-HER2 complexes () and the concentration of shed HER2 extracellular domain in circulation (). was the most important parameter governing trastuzumab distribution into tissues and primarily affected variability in the first 500 h post-administration. was the most significant contributor to variability in clearance. These findings were used together with population generation methods to accurately predict the observed variability in four experimental trials with trastuzumab. To explore anthropometric sources of variability, virtual populations were created to represent participants in the four experimental trials. Using populations with only their expected anthropometric diversity resulted in under-prediction of the observed inter-individual variability. Adapting the populations to include literature-based variability around the five key parameters enabled accurate predictions of the variability in the four trials. The successful application of this framework demonstrates the utility of popPBPK methods to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of pharmacokinetic variability.},

Taken together, these bookends got me thinking about the job of peer reviewing in a world where the politics of science, changes in technologies, and increasing market pressures are influencing scholarly institutions and their practices. This issue begins with Witkin's commentary on the two articles that immediately follow it. These articles are written by QSW founding editors, Ian Shaw and Roy Ruckdeschel along with a colleague Ann Ramatowski and are the product of analysis and reflection on their time as co-editors of this journal. Witkin's provocative essay pushes the discussion forward. We will see further dialogue among these scholars in a future issue of QSW but for the moment, I will let that conversation speak for itself. However, there are several threads in Witkin's piece that point to the challenges of current journal editing and, by extension, implicate journal reviewers who serve as gatekeepers, consultants, and cheerleaders. It is to these folks that I turn my attention. As is our tradition, we close the final issue of the year by publishing the names and affiliations of the individuals who have served as reviewers for us over the past year. You will find a list of 143 distinguished scholars from around the globe. If it takes three hours to review a single manuscript, as some have suggested, that would mean that these reviewers have logged in 429 hours of gratuitous intellectual labor for QSW (Hernandez, 2009; Sharts-Hopko, 2001). However, that figure greatly underestimates the time given. It does not account for the time it takes to review resub-missions, or the fact that most reviewers agree to take on more than one manuscript a year, nor does it account for the additional labor involved in reading, and writing, in a foreign language. Needless to say QSW could not function without the dedication and commitment of this group of individuals. Publishing their names is not nearly thanks enough for the time and energy they devote to the job. So it seems like a good time to reflect on the work they do and the important role that they play. Peer review is familiar to all of us. Whether we seek research funds, are looking to publish our books or articles, or are seeking promotion, we are likely to have our work evaluated by others. Yet the actual task of reviewing is often under-valued and under-appreciated. Griffiths and Baveye (2011) take note of the paradox that, 'academic peer Qualitative Social Work 12(6) 715-721 !

Very little objective evidence, however, has been amassed to guide the manuscript peer review process. Rather, it is learned by experience and mentoring: by doing reviews, receiving reviews of one's own work, and by obtaining feedback from seasoned reviewers.

abstract = {Some recent reports have revealed that the long scintigraphic appearance time (SAT), defined as the time between radionuclide injection and first sentinel lymph node (SLN) visualization in lymphoscintigraphy, is a negative predictive parameter of nodal metastasis in patients with melanoma. However, most of the methods used to measure the SAT were ambiguous because they utilized visualization in lymphoscintigraphy. We herein introduce a novel method by which to measure the SAT and lymphatic flow rate. The data of 33 patients with primary skin cancer were used. Sequential images were obtained using dynamic lymphoscintigraphy, and a time-activity curve of the SLN was created. The time at which the counts reached plateau was newly defined as an alternative to the SAT and was termed the scintigraphic saturation time (SST). The figure obtained by division of the distance by the SST was newly defined as an alternative to the lymphatic flow rate and termed the lymphatic transit rate (LTR). The SST was clearly determined. It ranged from 220 to 1430 s (mean, 805 s). Pathological examination revealed nodal metastasis in five patients. In 28 patients without metastasis, the mean LTR was in the order of lower limbs (4.07 ± 0.35 cm/min), upper limbs (2.67 ± 0.33 cm/min), trunk (1.79 ± 0.47 cm/min), and head and neck (1.11 ± 0.22 cm/min). The LTRs were higher in patients with nodal metastasis than those without. This method may be effective for accurate measurement of the SAT and lymphatic flow rate.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the previously unknown flow velocity in single lymphatic capillaries of humans in the supine position. Fifteen healthy subjects (10 women and 5 men; mean age 35.8 +/- 13.1 yr) were studied. Ten microliters of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (150,000 mol wt) were injected into the subepidermal layer of the foot dorsum. The filling of the microlymphatics from the resulting depot was visualized by fluorescence video microscopy and stored on videotape. Flow velocity in the microlymphatics was determined on the video screen by direct measurement of the advancement of dyed lymph during a given time. The following median velocities were obtained: 0.51 mm/s (0.27 and 0.61 mm/s for lower and upper quartiles, respectively) for velocity during initial network filling and 9.7 microns/s (6.9 and 14.2 microns/s for lower and upper quartiles, respectively) for resting velocity at the end of the filling period. Mean lymphatic capillary diameter was 54.8 +/- 8.2 microns, and mean network extension was 8.3 +/- 3.2 mm. The high filling velocities are probably due to increased interstitial pressure and volume caused by dye microinjection, whereas the values measured during the end of network filling seem to approach resting flow velocities.},

There needs to be an accurate re-evaluation of scientific observations to aid clinical management. Forty-nine combinations of tissue from the head and neck of 20 unembalmed human cadavers were studied. Six percent hydrogen peroxide was used to find the vessels. They were injected with radio-opaque mixture, dissected, photographed, and radiographed. Final results were transferred to the computer for analysis. Different sized lymphatic valves were found in the precollecting and collecting lymph vessels, the lymphatic trunks, and ducts. The intervals between the valves were of various lengths. Diverse lymphatic ampullae and diverticula were seen in precollecting and collecting lymph vessels. Initial lymph vessels arose from the dermis, the galea, and the mucosal membrane. The vasculature of the direct and indirect precollecting and collecting lymph vessels, lymphatic trunks, and ducts was recorded. The morphology of the human lymphatic vessels in the head and neck has been described and recorded using radiographs and photographs. Clin.

abstract = {Purpose: This first-in-human study of HD201 was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) equivalence between this biosimilar candidate and trastuzumab sourced in the European Union (EU-trastuzumab)*. Methods: In this randomized, blinded, single-dose comparative PK study, healthy male subjects were randomized to receive a single 6 mg/kg IV dose of HD201 or EU-trastuzumab. The primary PK end point was AUC 0–∞ . Equivalence was determined by using the predefined margins of 0.8 to 1.25. Other PK parameters were included as secondary end points. Findings: Baseline demographic characteristics for the 73 randomized subjects were similar across the 2 groups: median age 29 and 30 years old (ranges 19 - 45), median weight 78.6 and 81.7 kg (ranges 60.2 – 101). The 90{\%} CIs for the geometric least squares mean of the AUC 0–∞ were included within the margins of 0.8 to 1.25. All other PK parameters were comparable for both HD201 and EU-trastuzumab. The proportions of subjects who experienced adverse events related to the study drug were 61.8{\%} and 82.9{\%} in the HD201 and EU-trastuzumab groups, respectively. The most frequently reported adverse events related to the study drug were infusion-related reactions. No subjects had positive results for antidrug antibodies after a single dose. Implications: This study reported the PK equivalence between HD201 and EU-trastuzumab. HD201 was well tolerated with no safety concerns after single-dose administration in healthy male subjects.

abstract = {Background DMB-3111 is a biosimilar trastuzumab drug being jointly developed by Meiji Seika Pharma (Japan) and Dong-A Socio Holdings (Korea). We investigated the bioequivalence of DMB-3111 relative to trastuzumab. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence between DMB-3111 and trastuzumab and the pharmacokinetic, safety, and immunogenicity of both drugs in healthy Japanese adult males. Methods Seventy healthy Japanese adult males were randomized 1:1 to receive either DMB-3111 or trastuzu-mab as a single intravenous infusion (6 mg/kg) over 90 min. Bioequivalence was assessed in terms of the pharmacokinetic parameters of both drugs. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Immunogenicity was tested using anti-drug antibody (ADA) assays. Results The 90 {\%} confidence intervals of the treatment differences (DMB-3111 versus trastuzumab) in the mean log-transformed maximum concentration, the area under the concentration-time curves (from 0 min to the last measured value or from 0 min to infinity), mean residence time, and the terminal half-life were within the accepted range for bioequivalence [log(0.80) to log(1.25)]. The frequencies of AEs and adverse drug reactions were similar with both drugs. No ADA reactivity to DMB-3111 or trastuzumab was observed in any subject. Conclusions DMB-3111, a trastuzumab biosimilar, was bioequivalent to trastuzumab in terms of its pharmacoki-netics and showed similar safety after a single intravenous infusion at 6 mg/kg over 90 min in healthy Japanese adult males. DMB-3111 is likely to show similar efficacy and safety profiles to trastuzumab in cancer patients (Clini-calTrials.gov {\#}NCT02100917). Key Points DMB-3111, a trastuzumab biosimilar, and trastuzumab were founded to be pharmacokinetically bioequivalent. The safety profile of DMB-3111 was similar to that of trastuzumab. All obtained serum samples were negative for anti-drug antibody reactivity to either DMB-3111 or trastuzumab.},

METHODS: This was an open-label, single ascending dose study. Subjects were assigned to tocilizumab 162 mg or tocilizumab 162, 324, or 648 mg plus rHuPH20. PK and PD samples were collected after dosing and were estimated with non-compartmental methods. Geometric mean ratio (GMR) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-infinity) and (maximum serum concentration) Cmax with and without rHuPH20 was estimated using one-way analysis of variance. Safety and tolerability were monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: 48 subjects (12/cohort) received a single dose of tocilizumab with or without rHuPH20. For tocilizumab 162 mg, tocilizumab 162 mg/rHuPH20, tocilizumab 324 mg/rHuPH20, and tocilizumab 648 mg/rHuPH20, mean +/- SD tocilizumab PK parameters were 2,510 +/- 1,060, 2,860 +/- 468, 10,800 +/- 3,220, and 29,900 +/- 5,280 mugxh/ml for AUC0-infinity; 11.5 +/- 3.7, 16.2 +/- 2.8, 43.8 +/- 12.4, and 77.8 +/- 14.5 mug/ml for Cmax; and 89.1 +/- 41.1, 54.0 +/- 19.5, 66.0 +/- 26.8, and 86.1 +/- 50.6 h for tmax, respectively. Coadministration of tocilizumab 162 mg with rHuPH20 resulted in slightly increased exposure: GMR (90{\%} confidence interval) for AUC0-infinity, 1.20 (1.00 - 1.44) and Cmax, 1.45 (1.24 - 1.70). Increasing tocilizumab doses resulted in significant deviation from dose proportionality for tocilizumab Cmax (p = 0.0057) and AUC0-infinity (p {\textless} 0.0001). Changes in interleukin-6, soluble interleukin- 6 receptor, and C-reactive protein were also dose dependent and similar with and without rHuPH20. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab in combination with rHuPH20 resulted in slightly increased tocilizumab exposure compared with tocilizumab alone, whereas PD markers were comparable. Subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab with rHuPH20 was well tolerated.},

Tocilizumab absolute PK bioavailability (AUC∞ ratio (s.c./i.v.)) was higher at 162 mg (48.8{\%}) than at 81 mg (22.7{\%}). Tocilizumab PD bioavailability for soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) (AUClast ratio (s.c./i.v.)) was 109{\%} at 162 mg and 80.9{\%} at 81 mg. Tocilizumab PD bioavailability for C-reactive protein (CRP) effect was 98.2{\%} (CRP AUC480h ratio) at 162 mg and 80.4{\%} (AUC240h ratio (s.c./i.v.)) at 81 mg. Tocilizumab was well tolerated at both doses after s.c. and i.v. administration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab absolute PK bioavailability for s.c. vs. i.v. administration was low; however, the PD effects for sIL-6R and CRP levels were comparable after 162-mg s.c. and i.v. administration. Therefore, 162 mg s.c. dose is a comparable dose for 162 mg i.v. dose based on PD bioavailability.},

Eligible subjects were males, aged 20 to 45 years, weighing 50 to 90 kg with a body mass index of 19 to 30 kg/m(2). Japanese and Caucasian subjects were matched by body weight and dose group. Blood samples were collected through day 50 following a single subcutaneous injection of golimumab 50 or 100 mg. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using a noncompartmental method. All 51 subjects (24 Japanese, 27 Caucasian) were included in the safety analysis; 47 completed the study and were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. The pharmacokinetics of golimumab were comparable in both race groups. Peak concentrations were observed approximately 4 to 6 days after administration. No significant differences in exposure or mean half-life (range, 11-13 days) were observed between Japanese and Caucasian subjects at the same dose level. Regardless of race, serum golimumab exposure increased with increasing dose. Mean apparent clearance ranged from 12 to 19 mL/kg/d. Mean apparent volume of distribution (224-262 mL/kg) remained constant with an increase in dose. No antibodies to golimumab were detected.

The present work aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of daclizumab high-yield process (HYP) in healthy volunteers. Methods Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled , phase I studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics of daclizumab HYP in healthy volunteers following single subcutaneous administration (50, 150, or 300 mg), multiple subcutaneous administrations (100 or 200 mg biweekly with a 200 mg loading dose), or single intravenous administration (200 or 400 mg). Measurable serum concentrations (n = 925) from 70 subjects treated with daclizumab HYP in the three studies were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Results A two-compartment model with a first-order absorption and elimination adequately described dac-lizumab HYP pharmacokinetics. Daclizumab HYP clearance , inter-compartmental clearance, and central and peripheral volumes of distribution were 10 mL/h, 44 mL/h, 3.89 L, and 2.52 L, respectively, scaled by [bodyweight (kg)/70] with 0.54 and 0.64 exponents for clearance and volume parameters, respectively. Lag-time, mean absorption time, and absolute bioavailability (100-300 mg) for subcutaneous administration were 2 h, 4.6 days, and 84 {\%}, respectively. Bodyweight explained only *20 {\%} of dac-lizumab HYP pharmacokinetic variability. With this limited dataset, sex, age, race, or presence of antibodies did not correlate with daclizumab HYP clearance. The estimated effective half-life was 21-25 days. The developed model was robust in bootstrap evaluation and predicted the data adequately in stochastic simulations. Conclusions Daclizumab HYP is characterized by slow clearance, linear pharmacokinetics (at doses C100 mg), high subcutaneous bioavailability, and a half-life suitable for monthly administration. A population model that integrates and summarizes the phase I pharmacokinetic evaluations of daclizumab high-yield process (HYP), a monoclonal antibody under development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, has been developed. Daclizumab HYP is characterized by slow clearance, a small volume of distribution, linear pharmacokinetics (at doses C 100 mg), high subcutaneous bioavailability, and a half-life suitable for monthly administration.

abstract = {Background/Purpose: Belimumab is a recombinant, human Ig-G1lambda monoclonal antibody that binds and antagonizes the biological activity of soluble B-lymphocyte stimulator protein, a member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily that promotes the survival of B lymphocytes. This study (NCT{\#}01583530) evaluated the absolute bioavailability, PK, tolerability, and safety of belimumab (200 mg/mL) administered SC to healthy subjects as a single dose and as multiple doses up to 240 mg. Methods: In all, 118 healthy subjects (aged 18-55 y; body weight 51-115 kg) were enrolled. Seventy-eight subjects received a single dose of belimumab 240 mg IV, or 2 x 120, 1 x 240, or 1 x 200 mg SC. Forty subjects received 4 weekly injections of belimumab 2 x 120 or 1 x 200 mg SC. Randomization was stratified by weight ({\textless} vs {\textgreater} 75 kg) and, for SC administration, by injection site (abdomen vs thigh), with a target enrollment of 50{\%} women/treatment group. Serial blood samples were collected and the serum belimumab concentrations measured by a validated electrochemiluminescence-based assay. Belimumab PK parameters were derived by noncompartmental or compartmental analysis. Results: The bioavailability and PK parameters of belimumab following single IV and SC administration are summarized in the table. Following 4 weekly SC belimumab doses, bioavailability values (90{\%} CI) were 75{\%} (63{\%}-89{\%}) and 78{\%} (67{\%}-91{\%}) for the 2 x 120- and 1 x 200-mg SC groups, respectively. Four subjects had persistent positive immune responses; neutralizing antibodies in these subjects were not detected and there was no apparent impact on PK. Single and multiple dosing of belimumab was generally safe and well tolerated, with no severe/serious injection-site reactions, eg, rash, edema, erythema, and pruritus. (Table presented) Conclusion: Following single belimumab SC doses, bioavailability was 74{\%}-82{\%}, indicating that belimumab SC was well absorbed, and bioavailability was similar among the 3 SC groups. Bioavailability after 4 weekly SC doses was similar to that following single SC administration. Belimumab was generally safe and well tolerated after single and multiple SC dosing.},

abstract = {Background: Belimumab is a recombinant, human, IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets B-lymphocyte stimulator. The intravenous formulation is indicated for the treatment of active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Belimumab has been formulated for subcutaneous (SC) administration to improve patient convenience. This post-hoc modeling and simulation analysis characterizes the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of SC belimu-mab, and compares the exposure profiles of the approved belimumab IV dose-10 mg/kg every four weeks-to the 200 mg SC weekly dose in SLE patients, highlighting key pharmacological differences relevant for clinicians. Methods: Data from two Phase 1 studies in US American and Japanese healthy subjects were analyzed with a non-linear mixed effects mod-eling approach. The resulting SC population PK model and a previously developed IV population PK model were used to conduct simulation trials in a Phase 3 IV belimumab SLE patient population, comparing chronic exposure profiles and exposure ranges stratified by body weight tertiles for IV vs SC dosing. Results: The PK of belimumab following SC administration was best described by a linear two-comment model. The estimates for clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, and bioavailability were 208 mL/day, 5250 mL, and 76{\%}, respectively. After four weeks of SC dosing, simulated belimumab concentrations exceeded the steady-state trough concentrations of the IV dosing regimen. At steady state simulated serum profiles demonstrated comparable average belimumab concentrations (C avg,ss) after IV and SC dosing. Simulated belimumab exposures demonstrated largely overlapping concentration ranges following 200 mg SC weekly and 10 mg/kg IV every four weeks dosing. Discussion: The predicted C avg,ss of belimumab in SLE patients was comparable following 200 mg SC weekly and 10 mg/kg IV every four weeks dosing. The simulated belimumab accumulation following SC weekly dosing indicated that administration of a loading dose was not required. Similar C avg,ss ranges were predicted for fixed dose SC and weight-proportional IV regimens in the simulated SLE population, albeit with a reversed body-size-to-exposure relationship for the SC regimen. These findings provide rheumatologists with a better understanding of expected differences in belimumab exposure when comparing IV and SC dosing regimens. Lupus (2016) 25, 1448-1455.},

Primary PK endpoints were maximum observed concentration (C max), area under the curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf), and AUC from time 0 to 336 hours (AUC 0-336). Secondary endpoints included safety and immunogenicity assessments. Healthy subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a 40-mg dose of M923 (n = 107); adalimumab US Humira (n = 105), hereafter referred to as "US Humira"; or adalimumab EU Humira (n = 103), hereafter referred to as "EU Humira." PK equivalence was demonstrated for all primary PK endpoints. Geometric least squares means ratios (GMRs) for C max , AUC 0-inf , and AUC 0-336 were 99.4, 100.9, and 100.5, respectively, between the M923 and EU Humira arms and 102.6, 104.2, and 102.9 between the M923 and US Humira arms. The 90{\%} confidence intervals of the GMRs for all PK endpoints were within prespecified confidence bounds of 80{\%}-125{\%}.

abstract = {Optimization of the use of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) as diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer is aided by quantitative characterization of the transport and tissue disposition of these agents in whole animals. This characterization may be effectively achieved by the application of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. The purpose of this study was to develop a PBPK model to characterize the biodistribution of the pancarcinoma MAb CC49 IgG in normal and neoplastic tissues of nude mice, and to further apply the model to predict the disposition of multivalent single chain Fv (scFv) constructs in mice. Since MAbs are macromolecules, their transport is membrane-limited and a two-pore formalism is employed to describe their extravasation. The influence of binding of IgG to the protective neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) on its disposition is also accounted for in the model. The model successfully described 131 I-CC49 IgG concentrations in blood, tumor and various organs/tissues in mice. Sensitivity analysis revealed the rate of transcapillary transport to be a critical determinant of antibody penetration and localization in the tumor. The applicability of the model was tested by predicting the disposition of di-and tetravalent scFv constructs of CC49 in mice. The model gave reasonably good predictions of the disposition of the scFv constructs. Since the model employs physiological parameters, it can be used to scale-up mouse biodistribution data to predict antibody distribution in humans. Therefore, the clinical utility of the model was},

abstract = {Purpose-The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has been known to modulate IgG transport and protect against IgG catabolism, resulting in extension of the serum half-life of IgG. The goal of this study was to localize FcRn receptor expression in the rat's eye. Methods-The cornea, retina, conjunctiva, ciliary body and iris, retinal pigment epithelium and choroid, and lens were dissected from each rat's eye, and total RNA was purified. The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized and subjected to PCR reaction. For control samples, reverse transcriptase was omitted. A monoclonal antibody against the FcRn heavy chain was used to localize the distribution of the FcRn receptor in ocular tissues. Lymphatic vessels and blood vessels were stained with a rabbit anti-mouse lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1 polyclonal antibody and a rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor polyclonal antibody, respectively. Results-RT-PCR demonstrated expression of FcRn RNA in cornea, retina, conjunctiva, ciliary body and iris, and lens but absence of expression in the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. Immunohistochemistry and double staining confirmed the expression of FcRn receptor to the conjunctival lymphatic vessels but not in the conjunctival blood vessels. In the ciliary body, the FcRn receptor was found to be expressed in both the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium and the ciliary blood vessels. The expression of FcRn receptor was confirmed in the retinal blood vessels, iris blood vessels, optic nerve vascular structures, corneal epithelium and endothelium, and lens epithelium. Conclusions-The FcRn receptor is expressed in multiple ocular tissues. The blood-ocular barrier showed FcRn receptor expression, indicating that IgG transport from ocular tissues to the blood system may use this receptor. The role of the FcRn receptor in the anterior segment and the conjunctiva remains unclear. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn, FcRp, or Fcgrt) is a heterodimer composed of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I, which binds to both albumin and the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). 1,2 Unlike other Fc$\gamma$ receptors that bind to the lower hinge region and top of the C$\gamma$2 domain, the FcRn receptor binds to the interface between C$\gamma$2 and C$\gamma$3 of IgG. 2,3 The binding site of the FcRn receptor to the Fc fragment contains several histidine residues that account for a pH-dependent interaction. 2 This enables the FcRn receptor to transport IgG(s) into the blood by transcytosis, allowing intact IgG molecules to pass},

abstract = {Subcutaneous (SC) delivery is a common route of administration for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) properties requiring long-term or frequent drug administration. An ideal in vivo preclinical model for predicting human PK following SC administration may be one in which the skin and overall physiological characteristics are similar to that of humans. In this study, the PK properties of a series of therapeutic mAbs following intravenous (IV) and SC administration in G{\"{o}}ttingen minipigs were compared with data obtained previously from humans. The present studies demonstrated: (1) minipig is predictive of human linear clearance; (2) the SC bioavailabilities in minipigs are weakly correlated with those in human; (3) minipig mAb SC absorption rates are generally higher than those in human and (4) the SC bioavailability appears to correlate with systemic clearance in minipigs. Given the important role of the neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn) in the PK of mAbs, the in vitro binding affinities of these IgGs against porcine, human and cynomolgus monkey FcRn were tested. The result showed comparable FcRn binding affinities across species. Further, mAbs with higher isoelectric point tended to have faster systemic clearance and lower SC bioavailability in both minipig and human. Taken together, these data lend increased support for the use of the minipig as an alternative predictive model for human IV and SC PK of mAbs.},

Nevertheless, there is a notable disparity in terms of research effort expended in relation to the treatment of lymphatic diseases in contrast to the cardiovascular system. While similarities to the cardiovascular system exist, there are considerable differences in their anatomy and physiology. This review outlines some of the challenges and opportunities for those engaged in modelling biological systems. The study of the lymphatic system is still in its infancy, the vast majority of the models presented in the literature to date having been developed since 2003. The number of distinct models and their variants are few in number, and only one effort has been made thus far to study the entire lymphatic network; elements of the lymphatic system such as the nodes, which act as pumps and reservoirs, have not been addressed by mathematical models. Clearly, more work will be necessary in combination with experimental verification in order to progress and update the knowledge on the function of the lymphatic system. As our knowledge and understanding of its function increase, new and more effective treatments of lymphatic diseases are bound to emerge.},

abstract = {The supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues is performed by the blood system, and involves a net leakage of fluid outward at the capillary level. One of the principal functions of the lymphatic system is to gather this fluid and return it to the blood system to maintain overall fluid balance. Fluid in the interstitial spaces is often at subatmospheric pressure, and the return points into the venous system are at pressures of approximately 20 cmH2O. This adverse pressure difference is overcome by the active pumping of collecting lymphatic vessels, which feature closely spaced one-way valves and contractile muscle cells in their walls. Passive vessel squeezing causes further pumping. The dynamics of lymphatic pumping have been investigated experimentally and mathematically, revealing complex behaviours indicating that the system performance is robust against minor perturbations in pressure and flow. More serious disruptions can lead to incurable swelling of tissues called lymph{\oe}dema.},

The risk of second primary malignancy after tandem transplantation might possibly be greater than after a single autologous stem-cell transplant, as suggested by results of the Intergroupe Francophone du My{\'{e}}lome (IFM) study. 2 The actions of lenalidomide are complex and the mechanism of how it might cause second primary malignancies is not understood. Perhaps, in the case of treatment-related myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukaemia, it might be related to a stem-cell eff ect, in view of lenalidomide's ability to impair haemopoietic stem-cell mobilisation after prolonged use. Palumbo and colleagues' meta-analysis does have limitations, including a failure to include several studies, either because they were ongoing and unpublished (eg, the Myeloma XI trial [ISRCTN49407852]), or because the data were unavailable. Disappointingly, this included the large study by the IFM that was one of the fi rst to show an increased risk of second primary malignancies in patients with myeloma who received lenalidomide maintenance after autologous stem-cell transplantation. 2 In Palumbo and colleagues' meta-analysis, 502 patients received lenalidomide for more than 2 years and no obvious eff ect was noted with respect to duration (and, presumably, cumulative dose) and risk of second primary malignancies. Long-term follow-up of a greater number of patients receiving lenalidomide for longer than 2 years might be needed for reassurance regarding this point, particularly since lenalidomide is still given until disease progression. Recording of the development of second primary malignancies was not a prospectively designed endpoint of the studies included in this meta-analysis, and so some might not have been recorded. Finally, although second primary malignancies started to increase after 18 months, none of these studies can address whether a very long latency period takes place between exposure to lenalidomide and the peak in development of second primary malignancies, which would be useful to know as outcomes continue to improve for myeloma patients. The overwhelming message from this meta-analysis is that the risk of developing second primary malignancies after treatment with lenalidomide is low, and far outweighed by the risk of death from myeloma. Nevertheless, the combination of oral melphalan and lenalidomide might be best avoided, and alternatives used. Whether second primary malignancies will become clinically relevant as survival for patients with myeloma starts to improve beyond 7–10 years is uncertain. In future studies, second primary malignancies should be carefully recorded and assessed for any possible links with lenalidomide dose and duration, particular combination regimens, and possible host biological factors.},

abstract = {Purpose: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are commonly administered by subcutaneous (SC) route. However, bioavailability is often reduced after SC administration. In addition, the sequential transfer of mAbs through the SC tissue and lymphatic system is not completely understood. Therefore, major objectives of this study were a) To understand absorption of mAbs via the lymphatic system after SC administration using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, and b) to demonstrate application of the model for prediction of SC pharmacokinetics (PK) of mAbs. Methods: A minimal PBPK model was constructed using various physiological parameters related to the SC injection site and lymphatic system. The remainder of the body organs were represented using a 2-compartment model (central and peripheral compartments), with parameters derived from available intravenous (IV) PK data. The IV and SC clinical PK data of a total of 10 mAbs were obtained from literature. The SC PK data were used to estimate the lymphatic trunk-lymph node (LN) clearance. Results: The mean estimated lymphatic trunk-LN clearance obtained from 37 SC PK profiles of mAbs was 0.00213 L/h (0.001332 to 0.002928, 95{\%} confidence intervals). The estimated lymphatic trunk-LN clearance was greater for the mAbs with higher isoelectric point (pI). In addition, the estimated clearance increased with decrease in the bioavailability. Conclusion: The minimal PBPK model identified SC injection site lymph flow, afferent and efferent lymph flows, and volumes associated with the SC injection site, lymphatic capillaries and lymphatic trunk-LN as important physiological parameters governing the absorption of mAbs after SC administration. The model may be used to predict PK of mAbs using the relationship of lymphatic trunk-LN clearance and the pI. In addition, the model can be used as a bottom platform to incorporate SC and lymphatic in vitro clearance data for mAb PK prediction in the future.},

The primary endpoint was time to maximum plasma morphine concentration (T max) for SC injection with rHuPH20 vs. SC injection without rHuPH20. Safety and tolerability were assessed each study day, the day after the last injection, and 28 days after the last injection. After SC dosing, morphine mean T max was significantly shorter with rHuPH20 than without it. Mean maximum plasma morphine concentration (C max) after SC dosing was 29{\%} greater with rHuPH20 than without rHuPH20 (P ¼ 0.023), although the extent of exposure of morphine was similar. T max was shortest and C max was highest with IV administration. For the major active metabolite of morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, mean T max after SC morphine was significantly shorter with rHuPH20 than without rHuPH20 (a difference of approximately 17.5 minutes; P ¼ 0.0169).

The monoclonal antibodies available for this purpose are mainly administered intravenously in individually adapted doses according to body weight over longer treatment times. For other chronic diseases such as, for example, diabetes mellitus, the subcutaneous administration of drugs is an established therapy option. For the subcutaneous administration of larger volumes as needed for mab solutions the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue represents a problem. The co-formulation with recombinant human hyaluronidase makes the relatively pain-free administration of larger fluid volumes and thus the subcutaneous administration of monoclonal antibodies possible, as illustrated by the development of a subcutaneous formulation of trastuzumab. This constitutes a less invasive, time-optimised and flexible form of administration for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer that, with its fixed dosing possibilities, contributes to therapeutic safety. The example of trastuzumab shows that the subcutaneous administration of monoclonal antibodies can simplify oncological long-term therapy not only for the patients but also for the medical personnel.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.},

This complex, three-dimensional structure limits the type and quantity of drugs that can be administered by local injection. Here we found that depolymerization of the viscoelastic component of the interstitial matrix in animal models with a highly purified recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (rHuPH20) increased the dispersion of locally injected drugs, across a broad range of molecular weights without tissue distortion. rHuPH20 increased infusion rates and the pattern and extent of appearance of locally injected drugs in systemic blood. In particular, rHuPH20 changed the pharmacokinetic profiles and significantly augmented the absolute bioavailability of locally injected large protein therapeutics. Importantly, within 24 h of injection, the interstitial viscoelastic barriers were restored without histologic alterations or signs of inflammation. rHuPH20 may function as an interstitial delivery enhancing agent capable of increasing the dispersion and bioavailability of coinjected drugs that may enable subcutaneous administration of therapeutics and replace intravenous delivery. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Doses of RSHZ19 (0.025-10.0 mg/kg) or placebo were infused over 30 min, and subjects were followed for 10 weeks. Plasma concentrations of RSHZ19 and RSHZ19-specific antibodies were determined by ELISAs. FI titers were used to evaluate the ability of plasma to inhibit virus-induced fusion of VERO cells previously infected with RS Long strain virus. Twenty-six subjects, mean age 24, completed the study. RSHZ19 was safe and well tolerated, and no subject developed antibodies to RSHZ19 during follow-up. RSHZ19 had low plasma clearance and a half-life of {\~{}}23 days, similar to native IgG. Increases in FI titers relative to pretreatment levels were seen 24 h after MAb administration in all 4 subjects given 10 mg/kg and in 2 of 4 given 5 mg/kg. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pneumovirus of the family Paramyxoviridae, is a common respiratory pathogen in all age groups [1]. Infection with RSV tends to be seasonal with peaks in the winter in areas with temperate climates and during the rainy season in warmer regions. There are two sub-types, which differ primarily in the G surface glycoprotein. Although both subtypes, designated A and B, may circulate concomitantly during a single RSV season, one subtype usually predominates. Currently ribavirin, a synthetic nucleoside, is the only therapy approved for treatment of RSV infection. Pathologic changes associated with RSV infection include inflammation and necrosis of bronchiolar epithelium [2]. Airway obstruction leading to hyperinflation and atelectasis may be caused by mucous plugging that results from the inflammatory response to the virus. In some patients, wheezing may persist for years after presentation with bronchiolitis. The cause is unknown but may involve mediators such as RSV-specific IgE and leukotriene C4 [3].},

abstract = {This study characterized the pharmacokinetics (PK) of mepolizumab, after a single intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC), or intramuscular (IM) dose in healthy adults and determined the absolute bioavailability of SC and IM mepolizumab delivered at different anatomical regions. Sixty healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of either mepolizumab 250mg by IV, SC injection (upper arm, abdomen, or thigh); or IM injection (thigh). Following IV administration, the mean maximum observed plasma mepolizumab concentration (Cmax) and the mean area under the concentration versus time curves from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) were 109±17$\mu$g/mL and 1,557±250$\mu$gd/mL, respectively. After SC administration, the mean (±SD) values of Cmax and AUC(0-∞) were 34.1-38.2±7.3-12.1$\mu$g/mL and 1,110-1,238±228-372$\mu$gd/mL, respectively. Following IM administration, the mean values of Cmax and AUC(0-∞) were 46.9±10.6$\mu$g/mL and 1,395±348$\mu$gd/mL. The median terminal half-life was similar for SC, IM and IV administration (17.9-20.4, 19.2, and 18.5 days, respectively). The overall mean bioavailability of SC mepolizumab was 64-75{\%}, and absorption was relatively similar for the three SC injection sites. Mepolizumab 250mg was generally well tolerated in this study. These results support flexibility in the SC injection site for mepolizumab. {\textcopyright} 2013, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inhibition of the binding of Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) to its cellular receptor can abrogate the downstream toxin-mediated deleterious effects of the anthrax toxin. A fully human monoclonal antibody against B. anthracis PA, PAmAb, was previously shown to provide a survival advantage in rabbit and monkey models of inhalational anthrax. METHODS: A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study with 105 healthy volunteers was conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity of PAmAb. Subjects received PAmAb or placebo as a single intramuscular injection (11 subjects/cohort) or intravenous infusion (10 subjects/cohort). Three intramuscular dose levels (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg) and 5 intravenous dose levels (1.0, 3.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) were studied. Two separate intramuscular injection sites (gluteus maximus and vastus lateralis) were evaluated in the cohorts (hereafter, the "IM-GM" and "IM-VL" cohorts, respectively). RESULTS: PAmAb was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting adverse events. All adverse events were transient and mild to moderate in incidence and/or severity. The pharmacokinetics of PAmAb were linear within each route and site of administration but were significantly different between the IM-GM and IM-VL cohorts. The mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 15 to 19 days. The bioavailability of PAmAb is approximately 50{\%} for IM-GM injection and 71{\%}-85{\%} for IM-VL injection. The biological activity of PAmAb in serum, assessed using a cyclic adenosine monophosphate assay, correlated with serum concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: PAmAb is safe, well tolerated, and bioavailable after a single intramuscular or intravenous dose, which supports further clinical development of PAmAb as a novel therapeutic agent for inhalational anthrax.},

abstract = {Background: Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) genes represent about8{\%}of the human genome.Amember of the HERV family W, the Multiple Sclerosis-Associated Retrovirus (MSRV) gene, encodes an envelope protein (Env), which can activate a proinflammatory and autoimmune cascade through its interaction with Tolllike receptor 4. Due to its proinflammatory property and an inhibitory effect on oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation, the MSRV-Env protein could play a crucial role in the pathogeny of multiple sclerosis. GNbAC1 is a humanized monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G4 type, which is directed against MSRV-Env. After validation of the MSRV-Env as a therapeutic target in preclinical experimental models, a clinical development program was initiated. Objective: This study evaluated the safety profile, pharmacokinetic parameters, and immunogenicity of GNbAC1 in healthy male volunteers. Methods: In this first-in-humans, Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study, each subject received a single dose of IV GNbAC1 0.0025, 0.025, 0.15, 0.6, 2, or 6 mg/kg or inactive vehicle (placebo), infused over 1 hour. Tolerability and other laboratory parameters were observed, and regular blood sampling was performed, to study the pharmacokinetic properties and immunogenicity of this monoclonal antibody. Results: A total of 33 male subjects (mean age, 44 years) completed the study. GNbAC1 was well tolerated after dosing in all subjects and in each dose cohort. Only minor and nonspecific adverse events (AEs) were recorded; no serious AEs were reported. Pharmacokinetic data show a dose-linear pharmacokinetic profile. The mean elimination half-life ranged between 19 and 26 days, with therapeutically efficient concentrations maintained over a 4-week periods at doses of 2 and 6 mg/kg. No emergence of anti-GNbAC1 antibodies were detected after dosing in any subject over the entire observation period of 64 days. Conclusions: In these healthy male subjects, the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of GNbAC1 appeared favorable. These findings are expected to allow for the launch of a Phase II development program for this innovative therapeutic approach in patients with multiple sclerosis.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Metabolic activation of the innate immune system governed by interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$ contributes to $\beta$-cell failure in type 2 diabetes. Gevokizumab is a novel, human-engineered monoclonal anti-IL-1$\beta$ antibody. We evaluated the safety and biological activity of gevokizumab in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study, a total of 98 patients were randomly assigned to placebo (17 subjects) or gevokizumab (81 subjects) at increasing doses and dosing schedules. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety profile of gevokizumab in type 2 diabetes. The secondary objectives were to assess pharmacokinetics for different dose levels, routes of administration, and regimens and to assess biological activity. RESULTS: The study drug was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. There was one hypoglycemic event whereupon concomitant insulin treatment had to be reduced. Clearance of gevokizumab was consistent with that for a human IgG(2), with a half-life of 22 days. In the combined intermediate-dose group (single doses of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg), the mean placebo-corrected decrease in glycated hemoglobin was 0.11, 0.44, and 0.85{\%} after 1, 2 (P = 0.017), and 3 (P = 0.049) months, respectively, along with enhanced C-peptide secretion, increased insulin sensitivity, and a reduction in C-reactive protein and spontaneous and inducible cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: This novel IL-1$\beta$-neutralizing antibody improved glycemia, possibly via restored insulin production and action, and reduced inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes. This therapeutic agent may be able to be used on a once-every-month or longer schedule.},

abstract = {WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Interleukin (IL)-6 is a cytokine known for pleiotropic and pro-inflammatory functions. IL-6 is involved in various disease processes including lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, insulin resistance and malignancy. Anti-IL-6 receptor therapy has recently been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Sirukumab, a human monoclonal antibody against soluble IL-6, has been found to bind to human IL-6 with high affinity and specificity and thus suppress the biological activity of IL-6. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the safety of sirukumab in cynomolgus monkeys, a toxicologically relevant animal species, following repeated intravenous and subcutaneous administrations. This study shows that sirukumab has desirable pharmacokinetic characteristics (linear pharmacokinetics with long half-life), a low incidence of immunogenicity and a well-tolerated safety profile in healthy subjects, supporting further development of sirukumab as a potentially valuable therapeutic agent.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIMS: To assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of sirukumab (CNTO 136) following intravenous (i.v.) infusion in healthy subjects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Forty-five healthy adult subjects (38 men and seven women) were randomly assigned to receive a single i.v. dose of placebo or sirukumab (0.3, 1, 3, 6 or 10 mg kg(-1) in a dose-escalating manner). All treated subjects were observed for 96 h post infusion and underwent 20-week follow-up evaluations. Serum samples were collected to measure sirukumab concentrations, pharmacodynamic biomarkers and antibodies to sirukumab. Non-compartmental analysis and population PK modelling were conducted to characterize the PK of sirukumab.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Adverse events were generally brief in duration, mild or moderate in intensity and non-dose-dependent. No serious adverse events were observed in the sirukumab-treated subjects. Both C(max) and AUC(0,∞) increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. Median terminal half-life ranged from 18.5 to 29.6 days. A two-compartment model adequately described the PK of sirukumab following i.v. administration. Population estimates for the clearance (CL), the central volume of distribution (V(1)), the inter-compartmental clearance (Q) and the peripheral volume of distribution (V(2)) were 0.364 l day(-1), 3.28 l, 0.588 l day(-1) and 4.97 l, respectively. Compared with placebo subjects, a sustained decrease from baseline in C-reactive protein was observed in all sirukumab-treated dose groups, although no clear dose-response relationship was observed. No subjects were positive for antibodies to sirukumab.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Sirukumab had a well-tolerated safety profile, desirable PK characteristics and a low incidence of immunogenicity following an i.v. infusion of 0.3 to 10 mg kg(-1) in healthy subjects.},

In preclinical studies in mice, inhibition of IL-9 through neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment partially reduced airway hyperresponsive-ness and mast-cell progenitor migration to the lung. Objective: The goal of the present studies was to determine the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles and im-munogenicity of MEDI-528, a humanized immunoglobulin G1k anti-IL-9 mAb, in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: In separate open-label, Phase I dose-escalation studies, single doses of MEDI-528 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 9.0 mg/kg were administered as an intravenous infusion (20 mg/min administered over 1-40 minutes, depending on dose) and by subcutaneous injection. All subjects were followed for 84 days. Any laboratory test value outside the normal reference range was considered an adverse event (AE). Results: Twenty-four subjects were enrolled in the intravenous study, and 29 subjects were enrolled in the subcutaneous study. No deaths or serious or severe AEs occurred in either study. The most frequently reported AEs in the intravenous study were laboratory test abnormalities; the most frequently reported AEs in the subcutaneous study were pharyngolaryngeal pain, palpable lymph nodes, and laboratory test abnormalities. The single-dose pharmacokinetics of MEDI-528 were linear and dose proportional over the dose range studied with both routes of administration. The mean t 1/2 after intravenous administration was {\~{}}26 days (range, 25-28 days); the mean t 1/2 after subcutaneous administration ranged from 33 to 87 days across doses. A low titer (1:80) of antibodies to MEDI-528 was detected on day 84 in a single volun- teer receiving intravenous MEDI-528 3.0 mg/kg. No antibody titers were detected in any of the volunteers receiving subcutaneous MEDI-528. Conclusions: Administered intravenously or subcu-taneously, MEDI-528 had an acceptable safety profile and exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range studied in healthy adults in these Phase I studies. The findings support further investigation of MEDI-528 in multiple-dose trials in patients with asthma.

Serial blood sampling for PK and biomarkers was conducted up to 84 days postdose. A dose increase from 10 to 20 mg/kg led to 1.9- and 2.4-fold increases in mean C(max) and AUC∞, respectively. Median disposition half-life was 21.1 and 27.8 days at 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. At 10 and 20 mg/kg, figitumumab increased total IGF-1, free IGF-1, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3, and insulin by 4.1- and 4.8-, 8.3- and 12.1-, 2.4- and 2.9-, and 7.3- and 9.8-fold, respectively; increases were sustained throughout the 84-day period. There was a slight and transient elevation in IGF-2. Mean plasma glucose increased by 18{\%} and 16{\%} at 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. Most treatment-related adverse events were mild in severity; the most common included dry eye (n = 9) and ocular hyperemia (n = 9) in the 20-mg/kg group. No antidrug antibodies were detected. Overall, figitumumab (10 or 20 mg/kg) demonstrated PK properties typical of IgG2 antibodies and produced substantial and sustained increases in IGF-1 (total and free), IGFBP-3, and insulin.},

abstract = {WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES: Belimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds and antagonizes the biological activity of soluble B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) protein. BLyS appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the biological profile of belimumab suggests that it may have a therapeutic benefit in the treatment for the disease. In this healthy Japanese subjects study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single subcutaneous and intravenous injection of belimumab administered as a 200 mg/mL liquid formulation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, single-dose study in healthy Japanese subjects. Each subject received a single intravenous infusion or a subcutaneous injection of 200 mg belimumab. The pharmacokinetic parameters and safety parameters including local tolerance (injection site), biomarkers, immunogenicity and adverse events were evaluated up to 70 days post-dosing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: After a single intravenous or a subcutaneous administration of 200 mg belimumab, all 16 subjects completed the study. There were no serious adverse events or adverse events related to injection site reactions. All seven adverse events were considered mild or moderate in intensity and deemed unrelated to belimumab except for cellulitis following intravenous administration. The bioavailability of the single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg belimumab in the subjects was estimated to be 77{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}. Time to the maximum serum concentration after subcutaneous injection was 6{\textperiodcentered}5 days (median). The geometric mean terminal half-life was comparable between the two administration routes (17{\textperiodcentered}7 days intravenous and 15{\textperiodcentered}9 days subcutaneous). Serum immunoglobulin G level decreased slightly after each treatment. No subjects were found to produce antibelimumab antibodies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: A favourable absolute bioavailability in healthy Japanese subjects was seen following a subcutaneous injection of 200 mg belimumab. Considering the intersubject variability, exposures were consistent with those previously observed in healthy non-Japanese subjects. Safety and biomarker data were also consistent with previous non-Japanese clinical studies.},

Seventy-eight healthy adult males were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of golimumab 100 mg by IV (30-minute infusion, n = 23) or SC administration at different sites (upper arm, n = 18; abdomen, n = 18; thigh, n = 19). Serial blood samples were collected for PK characterization. Following IV administration , the mean maximum observed serum golimumab concentration (C max) and the mean area under the concentration versus time curves from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞) were 29.5 ± 5.8 µg/mL and 195.9 ± 48.9 µg⋅d/mL, respectively. After SC administration, the mean values of C max and AUC 0-∞ were 6.3 ± 2.8 µg/mL and 100.1 ± 29.2 µg⋅d/mL, respectively. The median terminal half-life was similar for SC and IV administration (10.9 and 11.8 days, respectively). The overall mean bioavailability of SC golimumab was 51{\%}, and absorption was similar for the 3 injection sites. Golimumab 100 mg was generally well tolerated in this study.

To assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of the intravenous formulation of golimumab, 36 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis were randomly assigned to receive a single infusion of placebo or golimumab (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg). Serum concentrations of golimumab were determined using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. In addition to the noncompartmental analysis and compartmental modeling, a population pharmacokinetics analysis using NONMEM was also conducted. Both the maximum serum concentration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve appeared to increase in a dose-proportional manner. The median half-life ranged from 7 to 20 days. A 2-compartment population pharmacokinetic model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of golimumab. The following pharmacokinetic parameters (typical value [{\%} coefficient of variation]) were estimated from the population pharmacokinetic model: clearance (CL: 0.40 [10.1{\%}] L/d), volume of distribution in the central compartment (V c : 3.07 [6.4{\%}] L), intercompartmental clearance (Q: 0.42 [15.5{\%}] L/d), and volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment (V p : 3.68 [11.8{\%}] L). Interindividual variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters was quantified for CL (44.3{\%}), V c (25.5{\%}), Q (44.6{\%}), and V p (44.6{\%}). Residual variability was estimated to be 15.0{\%}. Body weight was found to be an important covariate on V c. Golimumab was generally well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics of goli-mumab appeared to be linear over the dose range evaluated in this study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rituximab and trastuzumab were the first therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) approved in oncology. Both antibodies are delivered by the intravenous (IV) route, but recently subcutaneous (SC) formulations have been developed. Subcutaneous administration of mAbs can offer substantial patient and resource benefits compared with IV, but SC administration of some mAbs can be limited by drug volume. Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) temporarily degrades hyaluronan, allowing SC delivery of drug volumes that might not otherwise be feasible.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Clinical trials assessing coformulation of rituximab or trastuzumab with rHuPH20 for SC administration were reviewed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Phase I trials of rituximab SC maintenance therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma and trastuzumab SC in healthy volunteers and patients with early breast cancer have demonstrated substantially shorter administration times and comparable tolerability and pharmacokinetics compared with IV formulations. Rituximab SC 1400-mg and trastuzumab SC 600-mg doses were identified for further study. Phase III clinical data for rituximab SC 1400 mg have shown comparable efficacy to rituximab IV, and initial clinical data suggest comparable efficacy of trastuzumab SC 600 mg and the IV formulation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Coformulation with rHuPH20 may enable effective, well-tolerated, cost-effective, and convenient SC administration of rituximab and trastuzumab.

abstract = {Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is amplified or overexpressed in about 15{\%} of breast cancers and is associated with aggressive disease. Clinical benefits of trastuzumab have been established in the treatment of both early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer have to be treated with trastuzumab for one year in combination with and sequentially after chemotherapy. This requires that trastuzumab is intravenously infused over 30-90 minutes every 3 weeks for one year which is time-consuming for both the patient and the health care provider. Consequently, a subcutaneous formulation of trastuzumab using a recombinant human hyaluronidase has been developed. Recombinant human hyaluronidase transiently increases absorption and dispersion in the subcutaneous space of large therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, allowing subcutaneous administration of trastuzumab in about 5 minutes. Thus, subcutaneous trastuzumab could represent a new treatment option that could have benefit to both the patient and the health care system. This review focuses on the development of the subcutaneous trastuzumab formulation and analyzes clinical trials assessing the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of this new formulation.},

abstract = {Pharmacokinetic models of antibody distribution and dynamics are useful for predicting and optimizing therapeutic behavior. Targeted antigens are produced and distributed in various tissues in specific patterns in disease phenotypes. Existing models leave out significant mechanistic detail which would enable an understanding of how to modify therapeutics in an optimal manner to allow appropriate tissue penetration in either a healthy or diseased state. The model presented here incorporates additional complexity such as diffusion through endothelial barriers, differential transcytosis properties, FcRn-mediated recycling, and incorporates these properties in an organ-specific manner. This creates a platform which can be expanded upon to include understanding of the effect of target on therapeutic distribution and clearance, differences in dynamics during a diseased versus healthy state, differential dose strategies, and mechanistic translation between animal models and human disease state. This model represents a superior alternative to typical and potentially over-simplified scaling strategies utilized in most existing physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models. Ultimately, this will enable better therapeutic design and greater pharmacological effects.},

abstract = {Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models can over-predict maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)) following intravenous administration. A proposed explanation is that invariably PBPK models report the concentration in the central venous compartment, rather than the site where the samples are drawn. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate potential corrective models based on anatomy and physiology governing the blood supply at the site of sampling and incorporate them into a PBPK platform. Four models were developed and scrutinised for their corrective potential. All assumed the peripheral sampling site concentration could be described by contributions from surrounding tissues and utilised tissue-specific concentration-time profiles reported from the full-PBPK model within the Simcyp Simulator. Predicted concentrations for the peripheral site were compared to the observed C(max). The models results were compared to clinical data for 15 studies over seven compounds (alprazolam, imipramine, metoprolol, midazolam, omeprazole, rosiglitazone and theophylline). The final model utilised tissue concentrations from adipose, skin, muscle and a contribution from artery. Predicted C(max) values considering the central venous compartment can over-predict the observed values up to 10-fold whereas the new sampling site predictions were within 2-fold of observed values. The model was particularly relevant for studies where traditional PBPK models over-predict early time point concentrations. A successful corrective model for C(max) prediction has been developed, subject to further validation. These models can be enrolled as built-up modules into PBPK platforms and potentially account for factors that may affect the initial mixing of the blood at the site of sampling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modeling of pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic actions requires knowledge of the arterial blood concentration. In most cases, experimental measurements are only available for a peripheral vein (usually antecubital) whose concentration may differ significantly from both arterial and central vein concentration. METHODS: A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for the tissues drained by the antecubital vein (referred to as "arm") is developed. It is assumed that the "arm" is composed of tissues with identical properties (partition coefficient, blood flow/gm) as the whole body tissues plus a new "tissue" representing skin arteriovenous shunts. The antecubital vein concentration depends on the following parameters: the fraction of "arm" blood flow contributed by muscle, skin, adipose, connective tissue and arteriovenous shunts, and the flow per gram of the arteriovenous shunt. The value of these parameters was investigated using simultaneous experimental measurements of arterial and antecubital concentrations for eight solutes: ethanol, thiopental, 99Tcm-diethylene triamine pentaacetate (DTPA), ketamine, D2O, acetone, methylene chloride and toluene. A new procedure is described that can be used to determine the arterial concentration for an arbitrary solute by deconvolution of the antecubital concentration. These procedures are implemented in PKQuest, a general PBPK program that is freely distributed http://www.pkquest.com. RESULTS: One set of "standard arm" parameters provides an adequate description of the arterial/antecubital vein concentration for ethanol, DTPA, thiopental and ketamine. A significantly different set of "arm" parameters was required to describe the data for D2O, acetone, methylene chloride and toluene - probably because the "arm" is in a different physiological state. CONCLUSIONS: Using the set of "standard arm" parameters, the antecubital vein concentration can be used to determine the whole body PBPK model parameters for an arbitrary solute without any additional adjustable parameters. Also, the antecubital vein concentration can be used to estimate the arterial concentration for an arbitrary input for solutes for which no arterial concentration data is available.},

abstract = {The subcutaneous (SC) route is of growing interest for the administration of biotherapeutics. Key products on the biotherapeutic market such as insulins, but also several immunoglobulins or Fc-fusion proteins, are administered SC. Despite the importance of the SC route, the available knowledge about the processes involved in the SC absorption of biotherapeutics is limited. This review summarizes available information on the physiology of the SC tissue and on the pharmacokinetic processes after SC administration including "first pass catabolism" at the administration site as well as transport in the extracellular matrix of the SC tissue, followed by absorption into the blood circulation or the lymphatic system. Both monoclonal antibodies and other biotherapeutics are discussed. Determinants of absorption after SC administration are summarized including compound properties such as charge or molecular weight. Scale-up of animal data to humans is discussed, including the current shortcomings of empirical scaling approaches and the lack of suitable mechanistic approaches.},

abstract = {The efficacy of a novel diagnostic or therapeutic agent depends on its selective localization in a target tissue. Biodistribution studies are expensive and difficult to carry out in humans, but such data can be obtained easily in rodents. We have developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for scaling up data from mice to humans, the first such model for genetically engineered macromolecules that bind to their targets in vivo, such as mAbs. The mathematical model uses physiological parameters including organ volumes, blood flow rates, and vascular permeabilities; the compartments (organs) are connected anatomically. This allows the use of scale-up techniques to predict antibody distribution in humans. The model was tested with data obtained in human patients for the biodistribution of a mAb against carcinoembryonic antigen. The model was further tested for a two-step protocol: bifunctional antibodies and radiolabeled hapten, which compared favorably with data in both mice and humans. The model was useful for optimization of treatment parameters, such as dose and time interval of injections, binding affinities, and choice of molecular carrier. This framework may be applicable to other genetically engineered molecules (e.g., growth factors, antisense oligonucleotides, and gene-carrying vectors).},

Several approaches were compared for scaling model parameters from estimated values in rats.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The bioavailability of rituximab following subcutaneous injection was inversely related to the dose level and was dependent on the site of injection in mice. The overall rate of absorption was faster in mice as compared to rats. Subcutaneous absorption profiles were well described using the proposed structural model, in which the total receptor concentration, the affinity of rituximab to the receptor, and the degradation rate constant were assumed to be species independent.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous absorption processes show similar trends in rats and mice, although the magnitude differs between species. A mathematical model that combines the absorption of free and bound antibody with presystemic degradation successfully captured rituximab pharmacokinetics in both species, and approaches for sharing and scaling parameters between species were identified.},

abstract = {Efforts have been made to extend the biological half-life of monoclonal antibody drugs (mAbs) by increasing the affinity of mAb-neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding; however, mixed results have been reported. One possible reason for a poor correlation between the equilibrium affinity of mAb-FcRn binding and mAb systemic pharmacokinetics is that the timecourse of endosomal transit is too brief to allow binding to reach equilibrium. In the present work, a new physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model has been developed to approximate the pH and time-dependent endosomal trafficking of immunoglobulin G (IgG). In this model, a catenary sub-model was utilized to describe the endosomal transit of IgG and the time dependencies in IgG-FcRn association and dissociation. The model performs as well as a previously published PBPK model, with assumed equilibrium kinetics of mAb-FcRn binding, in capturing the disposition profile of murine mAb from wild-type and FcRn knockout mice (catenary vs. equilibrium model: r 2 , 0.971 vs. 0.978; median prediction error, 3.38{\%} vs. 3.79{\%}). Compared to the PBPK model with equilibrium binding, the present catenary PBPK model predicts much more moderate changes in half-life with altered FcRn binding. For example, for a 10-fold increase in binding affinity, the catenary model predicts {\textless}2.5-fold change in half-life compared to an ∼8-fold increase as predicted by the equilibrium model; for a 100-fold increase in binding affinity, the catenary model predicts ∼7-fold change in half-life compared to {\textgreater}70-fold increase as predicted by the equilibrium model. Predictions of the new catenary PBPK model are more consistent with experimental results in the published literature.},

Further clarification of factors related to treatment response can support improvements in clinical outcome and guide the development of novel immune checkpoint therapies. In this article, we have provided an overview of the pharmacokinetic (PK) aspects related to current ICIs, which include target-mediated drug disposition and time-varying drug clearance. In response to the variation in treatment exposure of ICIs and the significant healthcare costs associated with these agents, arguments for both dose individualization and generalization are provided. We address important issues related to the efficacy and safety, the pharmacodynamics (PD), of ICIs, including exposure–response relationships related to clinical outcome. The unique PK and PD aspects of ICIs give rise to issues of confounding and suboptimal surrogate endpoints that complicate interpretation of exposure–response analysis. Biomarkers to identify patients benefiting from treatment with ICIs have been brought forward. However, validated biomarkers to monitor treatment response are currently lacking.},

abstract = {Background: This phase I dose-escalation study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of cetuximab administered on an every-second-week schedule to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, on the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation. Patients and methods: The study comprised two parts: a 6-week cetuximab monotherapy dose-escalation phase and a subsequent combination therapy phase, during which patients received cetuximab, at the same dose/schedule as in the monotherapy phase, followed by irinotecan plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI). Patients in the control group received cetuximab as a 400 mg/m 2 initial dose, then 250 mg/m 2 /week and in the dose-escalation group, at 400-700 mg/m 2 , every second week. Results: Sixty-two patients were included in the study. The MTD of cetuximab administered on an every-second-week schedule was not reached. The safety profiles were similar across all groups. Response rates in the cetuximab monotherapy and combination therapy phases were 15{\%} and 42{\%}, respectively. Trough levels for the 500, 600 mg/m 2 and standard weekly regimens were comparable. Conclusion: Cetuximab can be safely administered once every second week at doses between 400 and 700 mg/m 2 , with 500 mg/m 2 being the most convenient and feasible dose for future studies.},

abstract = {Objective To determine the relationship between serum TNF-level and clinical response in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated by infliximab. This could be of value to predict clinical response to infliximab and to determine the optimal dose and interval between dosing of infliximab. RA patients who did not respond adequately to conventional doses (3 mg/kg) of infliximab were studied to see if increasing the dose or frequency of infliximab infusions would be more effective. Methods Fifty-five RA patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria and were receiving treatment by anti-TNF-(infliximab 3 mg/kg body weight every 8 weeks) were evaluated by: clinical disease activity using the Richie score index before receiving their scheduled infliximab infusion. Serum level of TNF-, as measured by competitive ELISA assay, was determined immediately before and 9-11 days after receiving infliximab. RApatients who did not respond adequately to treatment with infliximab were given either a larger dose of infliximab or given the infusion at six-week intervals. Their clinical response was then evaluated sixteen months later. Results Patients were divided into 2 groups according to Richie score, active group with score {\textgreater}10 (score 20.3 ± 7.7 mean ± standard deviation, n = 25) and inactive group with scores 10 (score 4.1 ± 3.2, n = 30). TNF-serum levels pre-inflix-imab infusion were significantly higher in the active group 76.1 pg/ml than the inactive group 38.0 pg/ml (P {\textless} 0.02). Whereas TNF serum level significantly dropped post infliximab in the inactive group (P {\textless} 0.05), it did not drop in the active group. The mean level of the post-infusion TNF-serum level was higher (76.6 ± 93.4 ng/ml) in the active than the mean level of the post-infusion serum TNF-levels in the inactive group (26.4 ng/ml ± 7.9) P{\textless} 0.01 using the t-test. Increasing the frequency was superior in RA patients'clinical outcome than increasing the dose of infliximab infusions. Conclusion RA patients who responded well to infliximab and had inactive disease at the time of the study have lower levels of serum TNF-which could be further suppressed by the recommended doses of infliximab. RA patients with active disease have higher serum levels of TNF-which could not be suppressed after the recommended doses of infliximab infusion. Changing the frequency of infliximab infusions in the active group was more effective than increasing the dose of infliximab in inducing improved clinical outcome. We suggest that the lack of suppression of TNF-in the active group could be due to inadequate dosing of infliximab or to the presence of a neutralizing antibody directed against infliximab. It remains to be seen if serum TNF-levels could be used as a guide in determining the dose and intervals between dosing of anti-TNF therapy in RA in order to achieve the desired clinical response.},

abstract = {The TNF antagonists adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept are effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis, but only adalimumab and infliximab have been found to be efficacious in Crohn's disease. The present studies evaluated the TNF-binding and complement-activating properties of adalimu-mab, infliximab, and etanercept to determine whether these properties may explain differences in their clinical efficacy profiles. Association and dissociation rates of binding to soluble TNF were measured by surface plasmon resonance, and were found to be similar for adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept, as were their calculated binding affinities. Avidity of binding to soluble TNF, measured by KinExA {\textregistered} technology, was 10-to 20-fold greater for soluble etanercept (K D = 0.4 picomolars [pM]) than for soluble adalimumab or infliximab (K D = 8.6 and 4.2 pM, respectively). 125 I-adalimumab,-infliximab, and-etanercept bound to membrane TNF (mTNF) on mTNF-transfected cells with similar affinities (K D = 483, 468, and 445 pM, respectively) that were each lower than for soluble TNF. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was induced in mTNF-transfected cells by adalimumab and infliximab, but was not induced in activated normal human PBMC by any of the 3 agents. In conclusion, the binding properties of adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept were similar for soluble TNF, and very similar for mTNF, yet none of the 3 was able to induce CDC in activated PBMC. These results suggest that the different clinical efficacy profiles of these agents are not explained by differences in either TNF-intrinsic binding properties or complement lysis.},

abstract = {A solid understanding of physiology is beneficial in optimizing drug delivery and in the development of clinically predictive models of drug disposition kinetics. Although an abundance of data exists in the literature, it is often confounded by the use of various experimental methods and a lack of consensus in values from different sources. To help address this deficiency, we sought to directly compare three important vascular parameters at the tissue level using the same experimental approach in both mice and rats. Interstitial volume, vascular volume, and blood flow were radiometrically measured in selected harvested tissues of both species by extracellular marker infusion, red blood cell labeling, and rubidium chloride bolus distribution, respectively. The latter two parameters were further compared by whole-body autoradiographic imaging. An overall good interspecies agreement was observed for interstitial volume and blood flow on a weight-normalized basis in most tissues. In contrast, the measured vascular volumes of most rat tissues were higher than for mouse. Mice and rats, the two most commonly utilized rodent species in translational drug development, should not be considered as interchangeable in terms of vascular volume per gram of tissue. This will be particularly critical in biodistribution studies of drugs, as the amount of drug in the residual blood of tissues is often not negligible, especially for biologic drugs (e.g., antibodies) having long circulation half-lives. Physiologically based models of drug pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics also rely on accurate knowledge of biological parameters in tissues. For tissue parameters with poor interspecies agreement, the significance and possible drivers are discussed.},

abstract = {Although it is known that FcRn, the neonatal Fc-receptor, functions to protect immune gamma globulin (IgG) from elimination, the influence of FcRn on the tissue distribution of IgG has not been quantified. In the present work, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model has been developed to characterize and predict IgG disposition in plasma and in tissues. The model includes nine major compartments, connected in an anatomical manner, to represent tissues known to play a significant role in IgG disposition. Each tissue compartment was subdivided into vascular, endosomal and interstitial spaces. IgG transport between the blood and interstitial compartments may proceed by convection through paracellular pores in the vascular endothelium, or via FcRn-mediated transcytosis across vascular endothelial cells. The model was utilized to characterize plasma concentration-time data for 7E3, a monoclonal antiplatelet IgG1 antibody, in control and FcRn-knockout (KO) mice. These data showed that high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 1g/kg, increased 7E3 clearance in control mice from 5.2 ± 0.3 to 14.4 ± 1.4 ml/d/kg; however, IVIG failed to increase the clearance of 7E3 in KO mice (72.5 ± 4.0 vs. 61.0 ± 3.6 ml/d/kg). Based on model fitting to the 7E3 plasma concentration data, simulations were conducted to predict tissue concentrations of IgG in control and in KO mice, and the predictions were then tested by assessing 7E3 tissue distribution in KO mice and control mice. 7E3 was radiolabeled with Iodine-125 using chloramine T method, and 125 I-7E3 IgG was administered at a dose of 8 mg/kg to control and KO mice. At various time points, subgroups of 3 mice were sacrificed, blood and tissue samples were collected, and radioactivity assessed by gamma counting.

abstract = {ONS-3010 is being developed by Oncobiologics Inc. (Cranbury, NJ, USA) as a biosimilar of Humira({\textregistered}). This randomized, double blind, single-center phase I study (EudraCT registration {\#} 2013-003551-38) was performed to demonstrate pharmacokinetic (PK) biosimilarity between two reference products (Humira({\textregistered}) EU and US) and ONS-3010 in healthy volunteers, and to compare the safety and immunogenicity profiles. In addition, the intended pharmacological activity was assessed and compared by application of a whole blood challenge. Hundred ninety-eight healthy volunteers received a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose of ONS-3010, Humira({\textregistered}) EU, or US. The pharmacodynamic effects were assessed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/aluminum hydroxide whole blood challenges (n = 36; n = 12 per treatment arm; male:female, 1:1). Equivalence was demonstrated on the PK endpoints (AUC0-inf, Cmax, and AUC0-last) based on bounds of 80-125{\%} for the ratio of the geometric means (ONS-3010/Humira({\textregistered})). The immunogenicity profiles were comparable between treatment groups, and there were no indications for differences in routine safety parameters. Administration of adalimumab resulted in the observation of dramatically reduced tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$) levels upon stimulation with LPS/aluminum hydroxide ({\textgreater}99{\%}), with no differences between the three treatment groups in terms of magnitude or duration. Adalimumab also resulted in a reduction of LPS/aluminum hydroxide-induced interleukin (IL)-8 release (maximally 30{\%}), suggested to have a causal relationship with the anti-TNF$\alpha$ treatment. LPS/aluminum hydroxide-induced release of IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6 was not inhibited by anti-TNF$\alpha$ treatment. Taken together, these data are promising for the further clinical development of ONS-3010, demonstrate the relevance of the LPS/aluminum challenge to monitor Humira({\textregistered}) effects, and emphasize the value of whole blood challenges for monitoring of proximal drug effects in healthy volunteers, and potentially in the target population.},

Following a preplanned blinded sample size re-assessment after more than 50{\%} of the originally planned subjects had been observed, the sample size was increased to 237 (79 per arm) to ensure 213 completers. Primary PK endpoints analyzed by non-compartmental methods, were area under the curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0,∞)), maximum observed concentration (C max), and AUC from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC(0,t last)). PK equivalence was declared if the 90{\%} CI for the test : reference ratio lay within the 80-125{\%} equivalence margin. Bioequivalence was demonstrated if all three PK parameters met the PK equivalence criteria. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. RESULTS Mean serum concentration-time profiles for the three treatments were similar. MSB11022 demonstrated PK equivalence to US-RP and EU-RMP for all primary endpoints. The geometric means of AUC(0,∞), C max and AUC(0,t last) following a single dose of MSB11022 were 2276.05 $\mu$g ml-1 h, 3.44 $\mu$g ml-1 and 1983.90 $\mu$g ml-1 h, respectively. Adverse events (AEs) were similar across all groups, with treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) reported by 62.8{\%}, 56.3{\%} and 62.0{\%} of subjects within the MSB11022, US-RP and EU-RMP groups, respectively.

Target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) corresponds to a special case wherein a significant proportion of a drug (relative to dose) is bound with high affinity to a pharmacological target, such that this interaction is reflected in the pharma-cokinetic properties of the drug. Dose-dependent effects on apparent pharmacokinetic parameters may manifest, including the steady-state volume of distribution and total systemic clearance. Although a few small molecular weight compounds have been identified to exhibit TMDD, the incidence of TMDD is likely to increase particularly among emerging biotechnology pharmaceuticals. The goal of this commentary is to describe the basic tenets of TMDD and discuss several mathematical modeling approaches for characterizing this phenomenon. Whereas traditional pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models assume that the amount of the drug-target complex is negligible relative to the total amount of drug in the body, integrated mechanism-based models of TMDD incorporate the binding and stoichiometry of drug-target binding. These models may be utilized to infer the time-course of inaccessible system variables, such as the in vivo density of the drug-target complex, and provide a suitable platform for ascertaining the apparent pharmaco-dynamic implications of TMDD. a v a i l a b l e a t w w w. s c i e n c e d i r e c t. c o m j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w. e l s e v i e r. c o m / l o c a t e / b i o c h e m p h a r m},

abstract = {Biologics or therapeutic proteins are becoming increasingly important as treatments for disease. The most common class of biologics are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Recently, there has been an increase in the use of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling in the pharmaceutical industry in drug development. We review PBPK models for therapeutic proteins with an emphasis on mAbs. Due to their size and similarity to endogenous antibodies, there are distinct differences between PBPK models for small molecules and mAbs. The high-level organization of a typical mAb PBPK model consists of a whole-body PBPK model with organ compartments interconnected by both blood and lymph flows. The whole-body PBPK model is coupled with tissue-level submodels used to describe key mechanisms governing mAb disposition including tissue efflux via the lymphatic system, elimination by catabolism, protection from catabolism binding to the neonatal Fc (FcRn) receptor, and nonlinear binding to specific pharmacological targets of interest. The use of PBPK modeling in the development of therapeutic proteins is still in its infancy. Further application of PBPK modeling for therapeutic proteins will help to define its developing role in drug discovery and development.},

They provide a mechanistic framework to understand and extrapolate PK and dose across in vitro and in vivo systems and across different species, populations and disease states. Using small molecule and large molecule examples from the literature and our own company, we have shown how PBPK techniques can be utilised for human PK and dose prediction. Such approaches have the potential to increase efficiency, reduce the need for animal studies, replace clinical trials and increase PK understanding. Given the mechanistic nature of these models, the future use of PBPK modelling in drug discovery and development is promising, however some limitations need to be addressed to realise its application and utility more broadly.},

Patients with RA who had been taking stable doses of MTX (mean dose, 17 mg/wk) for ≥3 months before enrollment with an inadequate response were randomly assigned to receive 2 single doses of either adalimumab 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg IV or placebo in the double-blind phase. In the open-label phase, patients received treatment with 1 of the doses of adalimumab every other week or monthly for 18 months; patients were then switched to adalimumab 40 mg IV or SC every other week or monthly The main efficacy end point was 20{\%} improvement in American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20). Other efficacy end points included 50{\%} (ACR50) and 70{\%} improvements in ACR response criteria. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed for adalimumab and MTX during both phases of the study. Serum adalimumab concentrations were analyzed using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay relying on the double-antigen principle. Peak and trough concentrations were determined from observed concentration-time data, and a modeling approach was used to estimate total serum clearance, mean apparent terminal half-life, apparent volume of distribution at steady state, and area under the concentration-time curve. Results: Sixty patients entered the double-blind phase, 45 receiving adalimumab and 15 receiving placebo; 1 placebo recipient chose not to continue into the open-label phase. Overall, the study population included 47 (78.3{\%}) women and 13 (21.7{\%}) men. The mean age was 52.9 years (range, 24-73 years), and the mean body weight was 69.7 kg (range, 43-98 kg). ACR20 and ACR50 responses were achieved on at least 1 assessment during the 4-week double-blind phase by a respective 29 (64.4{\%}) and 11 (24.4{\%}) of 45 patients receiving active treatment and by 4 (26.7{\%}) and none of the 15 patients receiving placebo. Responses to adalimumab were rapid, with 10 (22.2{\%}) of 45 patients achieving an ACR20 response within 24 hours of dosing. Of 29 adalimumab recipients who had an ACR20 response, 18 (62.1{\%}) had a duration of response (time from first occurrence of a response to first occurrence of a nonresponse) of 1 to 2 weeks, and 11 (37.9{\%}) had a duration of response of 3 to 13 weeks. The pharmacokinetic properties of adalimumab appeared to be linear. The mean apparent terminal half-life after a single intravenous dose of adalimumab ranged from 15 to 19 days in the 5 dose groups. Repeated administration of adalimumab had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of MTX, indicating that dose adjustment of MTX is not necessary Adalimumab was well tolerated, and there were no doserelated adverse events. Conclusions: Among patients with active RA who had not had an adequate response to MTX, addition of adalimumab to MTX achieved statistically significant, long-term improvement compared with placebo plus MTX (P ≤ 0.05), as indicated by ACR responses at 26 months. The combination was well tolerated. Adalimumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics. In this selected patient population, adalimumab's long half-life of 15 to 19 days supports every-other-week dosing. Coadministration of adalimumab did not alter serum levels of MTX. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2003 Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

abstract = {Background Infliximab (IFX) is effective in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Currently, IFX is administered at fixed doses and intervals; however, costs are high and optimisation is necessary. Several publications indicate that IFX should be dosed on trough levels {\textgreater}3.0 mg/L. For optimising IFX dosing, the use of a pharmacokinetic model is important. Population pharmacokinetics of IFX have been described earlier; however, these models were not used for dose optimising. Aims To develop a pharmacokinetic model for IFX in IBD patients that can be used for dose-optimisation of IFX and to predict serum trough levels in this population. Methods An observational retrospective study was performed in 42 IFX-treated IBD patients. Serum samples were drawn before infusion at T = 0, 2, 6, 14, 22 and 54 weeks and analysed for IFX and antibodies against IFX (ATI). Relevant covariates were recorded and a population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Results Individual plots created using the final model showed good correspondence between observed and model predicted values. Serum levels were influenced by ATI, disease activity, sex and albumin. Our results show that in patients without ATI target trough levels {\textgreater}3.0 mg/L can be achieved by increasing dosing intervals from 8 to 12 weeks combined with a dose increase. This results in a reduction of 33{\%} in concomitant costs. Conclusions In IBD patients without ATI, trough level dosing based on longer intervals can reduce IFX therapy-related visits to the hospital with one-third. Trough level based dose intensification should always be justified by disease activity parameters.},

abstract = {AIMS This study aimed at describing adalimumab pharmacokinetics (PK) and the concentration-effect relationship of adalimumab using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS Adalimumab PK and PK-PD data were obtained from a multicentric observational study. Adalimumab (40 mg) was administered subcutaneously every other week, and its pharmacokinetics was described using a one-compartment model. The relationship between adalimumab concentration and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was described using an indirect response model with inhibition of CRP input, whereas the relationship between adalimumab concentration and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) was described using a direct inhibition model. Dose regimens that included a loading dose of adalimumab were simulated. RESULTS Thirty patients treated for RA were analysed. The following pharmacokinetic and PK-PD parameters were estimated (interidividual coefficient of variation): apparent volume of distribution (Vd /F) = 10.8 l (92{\%}); apparent clearance (CL/F) = 0.32 l day(-1) (17{\%}); first-order absorption rate (ka ) = 0.28 day(-1) ; CRP input (kin ) = 22.0 mg l(-1) day(-1) (65{\%}); adalimumab concentration leading to a 50{\%} decrease in kin (C50 ) = 3.6 mg l(-1) (88{\%}); baseline DAS28 (DAS0 ) = 5.5 mg l(-1) (11{\%}); and adalimumab concentration leading to 50{\%} decrease of DAS0 (IC50 ) = 11.0 mg l(-1) (71{\%}). Simulations showed that a 160 mg loading dose should reduce the time to reach efficacy in terms of both CRP and DAS28 after the first injection. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to describe adalimumab pharmacokinetics and the concentration-effect relationship in RA. A 160 mg loading dose may lead to an increased benefit from treatment in RA patients.},

abstract = {Aims: To compare the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of FKB327, a biosimilar of adalimumab, with European Union (EU)-approved Humira and US-licensed Humira after single subcutaneous doses in healthy subjects. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, 180 healthy subjects received by subcutaneous injection 40 mg of EU-Humira, or US-Humira, or FKB327, in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by bodyweight. Pharmacokinetics, local tolerability, immunogenicity, adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiography and laboratory safety tests were assessed prior to and up to 1536 h after treatment. Results: The pharmacokinetics of FKB327 were similar to those of both EU- and US-Humira. The 90{\%} confidence interval for the ratios of AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax geometric means were in the acceptance range for bioequivalence of 0.80-1.25 for all three pairwise comparisons by analysis of covariance with baseline characteristics age, body weight and (for Cmax only) sex as covariates. Tolerability of all three treatments was equally acceptable, and there were no differences in safety profile or immunogenicity among the three treatments. Overall, antidrug antibodies were detected in approximately 70{\%} of subjects who received each treatment; higher titres were associated with faster elimination of adalimumab. Conclusions: The study demonstrated pharmacokinetic similarity of FKB327 with EU- and US-Humira. FKB327 was well tolerated by healthy subjects, with adverse effects similar to Humira. If clinical similarity to Humira, including efficacy, can be shown in patients, FKB327 will meet the criteria for biosimilarity to Humira.},

abstract = {Background: Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF$\alpha$. The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of infliximab have been studied in several adult patient populations, but a literature search identified no reported comparative population PK properties of this drug in pediatric patients. Objectives: The current analysis applied population PK techniques to compare data on the PK properties of infliximab in pediatric and adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) from 2 Phase III studies. Methods: This analysis used serum infliximab concentration data from 692 patients (112 children, 580 adults; age range, 6-76 years) from 2 Phase III clinical studies (REACH [A Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Anti-TNF-$\alpha$ Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody in Pediatric Subjects with Moderate-to-Severe Crohn's Disease] and ACCENT I [A Crohn's Disease Clinical Trial Evaluating Infliximab in a New, Long-term Treatment Regimen]). PK models were developed separately for children, adults, and a combination of both. The combined population was used for establishing important covariates of infliximab PK properties in the combined CD population. Exploratory simulations using combined PK and covariate data were performed to expand the interpretation of the results in children. Results: Based on the findings, in a typical child (who, based on the median values in REACH, weighs 42 kg, has a baseline serum albumin concentration [SAC] 3.8 mg/dL, and has not developed antibodies to infliximab [ATIs]) who is receiving infliximab and an immunomodulator, PK estimates (typical value [SE]) were as follows: clearance (CL), 5.43 (0.15) mL/kg/d; Vdin the central compartment (V1), 54.2 (1.15) mL/kg; Vdin the peripheral compartment (V2), 29.2 (2.03) mL/kg; and intercompartmental clearance (Q), 3.52 (0.71) mL/kg/d. Corresponding properties in a typical adult (weight, 68 kg; SAC, 4.1 mg/dL) were CL, 5.39 (0.13) mL/kg/d; V1, 52.7 (0.49) mL/kg; V2, 19.0 (1.53) mL/kg; and Q, 2.15 (0.39) mL/kg/d. V2decreased as body weight increased, predicting a possible undercompensation for exposure with infliximab dosing per kg weight in lower-weight individuals. In pediatric and adult patients, CL was higher in those in whom ATIs developed or who had low baseline SAC. Concurrent immunomodulator use (purine antimetabolites or methotrexate) was associated with a 14{\%} decrease in CL. In the pediatric and adult patients, observed trough serum infliximab concentrations, median infliximab t1/2(in children, 13.2 days; and in adults, 12.4 days), and exploratory PK simulations predicted infliximab PK properties to be comparable between children and adults. Conclusions: Infliximab PK properties appeared to be comparable between pediatric and adult patients with CD. Specifically, in this select population using nonlinear mixed effects modeling, infliximab CL increased as SAC decreased. CL also increased with ATI formation but decreased with immunomodulator coadministration. Although weight affects infliximab PK properties (total CL and total Vd increased with total body weight while per kg CL and Vd decrease with total body weight), age was not found to influence infliximab PK in the age range tested (6-76 years). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.},

abstract = {Bevacizumab [Avastin; anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody] is an antiangiogenic IgG approved for treating patients with certain types of colon, breast, and lung cancer. In these indications, bevacizumab is administered every 2 to 3 weeks, prompting us to study ways to reduce the frequency of administration. Increasing affinity to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) may extend the pharmacokinetic half-life of an antibody, but the quantitative effect of FcRn affinity on clearance has not been clearly elucidated. To gain further insight into this relationship, we engineered a series of anti-VEGF antibody variants with minimal amino acid substitutions and showed a range of half-life improvements in primates. These results suggest that, if proven clinically safe and effective, a modified version of bevacizumab could potentially provide clinical benefit to patients on long-term anti-VEGF therapy through less-frequent dosing and improved compliance with drug therapy. Moreover, despite having half-life similar to that of wild-type in mice due to the species-specific FcRn binding effects, the variant T307Q/N434A exhibited superior in vivo potency in slowing the growth of certain human tumor lines in mouse xenograft models. These results further suggest that FcRn variants may achieve increased potency through unidentified mechanisms in addition to increased systemic exposure.},

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to propose a quantitative model to describe the absorption process for monoclonal antibody (mAb) following subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) administration. A hybrid model was established by coupling the physiologically based absorption process with a conventional pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) or PK model associated with intravenous infusion. Key physiological parameters evaluated include the volume distribution before systemic absorption, mAb drug clearance during lymphatic transport, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) capacity, the intrinsic drug clearance via lysosomal proteolytic process, and the lymphatic flow rate. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify those physiological parameters significantly impacting time to peak concentration (T(max)) or drug bioavailability. Simulation results showed that lymphatic flow rate is the only influential factor to T(max). Lymphatic transit time and drug clearance during lymphatic transport are most influential to bioavailability but not identifiable in their effects. Bioavailability is positively related to the lymphatic flow only at its low range (i.e., at {\textless}0.5-fold of the selected value of 0.043 mL/min). The rest of physiological parameters only have marginal effects on either drug bioavailability or T(max). Finally, simulation results confirmed lymphatic transport as the major route of mAb delivery.},

@article{Danhof2016,
abstract = {Mechanism-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) and disease system (DS) models have been introduced in drug discovery and development research, to predict in a quantitative manner the effect of drug treatment in vivo in health and disease. This requires consideration of several fundamental properties of biological systems behavior including: hysteresis, non-linearity, variability, interdependency, convergence, resilience, and multi-stationarity. Classical physiology-based PKPD models consider linear transduction pathways, connecting processes on the causal path between drug administration and effect, as the basis of drug action. Depending on the drug and its biological target, such models may contain expressions to characterize i) the disposition and the target site distribution kinetics of the drug under investigation, ii) the kinetics of target binding and activation and iii) the kinetics of transduction. When connected to physiology-based DS models, PKPD models can characterize the effect on disease progression in a mechanistic manner. These models have been found useful to characterize hysteresis and non-linearity, yet they fail to explain the effects of the other fundamental properties of biological systems behavior. Recently systems pharmacology has been introduced as novel approach to predict in vivo drug effects, in which biological networks rather than single transduction pathways are considered as the basis of drug action and disease progression. These models contain expressions to characterize the functional interactions within a biological network. Such interactions are relevant when drugs act at multiple targets in the network or when homeostatic feedback mechanisms are operative. As a result systems pharmacology models are particularly useful to describe complex patterns of drug action (i.e. synergy, oscillatory behavior) and disease progression (i.e. episodic disorders). In this contribution it is shown how physiology-based PKPD and disease models can be extended to account for internal systems interactions. It is demonstrated how SP models can be used to predict the effects of multi-target interactions and of homeostatic feedback on the pharmacological response. In addition it is shown how DS models may be used to distinguish symptomatic from disease modifying effects and to predict the long term effects on disease progression, from short term biomarker responses. It is concluded that incorporation of expressions to describe the interactions in biological network analysis opens new avenues to the understanding of the effects of drug treatment on the fundamental aspects of biological systems behavior.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This phase I dose-escalation study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of cetuximab administered on an every-second-week schedule to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, on the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised two parts: a 6-week cetuximab monotherapy dose-escalation phase and a subsequent combination therapy phase, during which patients received cetuximab, at the same dose/schedule as in the monotherapy phase, followed by irinotecan plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI). Patients in the control group received cetuximab as a 400 mg/m(2) initial dose, then 250 mg/m(2)/week and in the dose-escalation group, at 400-700 mg/m(2), every second week. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included in the study. The MTD of cetuximab administered on an every-second-week schedule was not reached. The safety profiles were similar across all groups. Response rates in the cetuximab monotherapy and combination therapy phases were 15{\%} and 42{\%}, respectively. Trough levels for the 500, 600 mg/m(2) and standard weekly regimens were comparable. CONCLUSION: Cetuximab can be safely administered once every second week at doses between 400 and 700 mg/m(2), with 500 mg/m(2) being the most convenient and feasible dose for future studies.},

abstract = {We conducted a phase I pharmacokinetic dose escalation study of a recombinant humanized anti-p185HER2 monoclonal antibody (MKC-454) in 18 patients with metastatic breast cancer refractory to chemotherapy. Three or six patients at each dose level received 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg kg(-1) of MKC-454 as 90-min intravenous infusions. The first dose was followed in 3 weeks by nine weekly doses. Target trough serum concentration has been set at 10 microg ml(-1) based on in vitro observations. The mean value of minimum trough serum concentrations at each dose level were 3.58 +/- 0.63, 6.53 +/- 5.26, 40.2 +/- 7.12 and 87.9 +/- 23.5 microg ml(-1) respectively. At 2 mg kg(-1), although minimum trough serum concentrations were lower than the target trough concentration with a wide range of variation, trough concentrations increased and exceeded the target concentration, as administrations were repeated weekly. Finally 2 mg kg(-1) was considered to be sufficient to achieve the target trough concentration by the weekly dosing regimen. One patient receiving 1 mg kg(-1) had grade 3 fever, one at the 1 mg kg(-1) level had severe fatigue defined as grade 3, and one at 8 mg kg(-1) had severe bone pain of grade 3. No antibodies against MKC-454 were detected in any patients. Objective tumour responses were observed in two patients; one receiving 4 mg kg(-1) had a partial response in lung metastases and the other receiving 8 mg kg(-1) had a complete response in soft tissue metastases. These results indicate that MKC-454 is well tolerated and effective in patients with refractory metastatic breast cancers overexpressing the HER2 proto-oncogene. Further evaluation of this agent with 2-4 mg kg(-1) weekly intravenous infusion is warranted.},

abstract = {AIM: Rituximab has dramatically improved the survival of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the dosing regimen currently used should be optimized. However, the concentration-effect relationship of rituximab has never been described by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling, precluding the simulation of new dosing regimens. The aim of this study was to develop a PK-PD model of rituximab in relapsed/resistant follicular NHL (FL). METHODS: A model describing the relationship between rituximab concentrations and progression-free survival (PFS) was developed using data extracted from the pivotal study, which evaluated 151 relapsed/resistant FL patients. The influence of FCGR3A genetic polymorphism on the efficacy of rituximab was quantified using data from 87 relapsed/resistant FL patients. The predictive performance of the model was analysed using two independent datasets: a study that evaluated rituximab combined with chemotherapy [rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin and prednisone (R-CHOP)] in 334 relapsed/resistant FL patients and a study that evaluated rituximab monotherapy in 47 asymptomatic FL patients with known FCGR3A genotype. RESULTS: For R-CHOP, observed and model-predicted PFS (90{\%} confidence interval) at 24 months were 0.50 and 0.48 (0.40, 0.56), respectively, for the observation arm, and 0.62 and 0.59 (0.50, 0.65), respectively, for the rituximab maintenance arm. For rituximab monotherapy, observed and predicted PFS at 24 months were 0.67 and 0.63, respectively, for FCGR3A-V/V patients, and 0.41 and 0.36 (0.25, 0.49), respectively, for FCGR3A-F carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Our model provides a satisfactory prediction of PFS at 24 months. It can be used to simulate new dosing regimens of rituximab in populations of FL patients and should improve the design of future clinical trials.},

The purpose of this study is to (a) compare the plasma pharmaco- kinetics of T84.66, a monoclonal anti-CEA antibody directed against tumor associated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), in control and CEA expressing LS174T xenograft bearing mice, and (b) to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model capable of integrating the influence of CEA and the IgG salvage receptor, FcRn, on T84.66 disposition. T84.66 pharmacokinetics were studied following i.v. administration (1, 10, 25 mg/kg) in control and xenograft bearing mice. In control mice, no significant differences in clearance were observed across the dose range studied. In mice bearing xenograft tumors, clearance was increased by four- to sevenfold, suggesting the presence of a ‘‘target mediated'' elimination pathway. T84.66 plasma disposition was character- ized with a PBPK model, and the model was applied to successfully predict antibody concentrations in tumor tissue. The PBPK model will be used to assist in the develop- ment of antibody-based targeting strategies for CEA-positive tumors. ?},

abstract = {High variability in patient outcome after rituximab-based treatment is partly explained by rituximab concentrations, and pharmacokinetic (PK) variability could be influenced by tumor burden. We aimed at quantifying the influence of baseline total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV0) on rituximab PK and of TMTV0 and rituximab exposure on outcome in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). TMTV0 was measured by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography-computed tomography in 108 previously untreated DLBCL patients who received four 375mg/m2 rituximab infusions every 2 weeks in combinationwith chemotherapy in 2 prospective trials. A 2-compartment populationmodel allowed describing rituximab PK and calculating rituximab exposure (area under the concentration-time curve; AUC). The association of TMTV0 and AUC with metabolic response after 4 cycles, as well as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), was assessed using logistic regression and Coxmodels, respectively. Cutoff values for patient outcomewere determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Exposure to rituximab decreased as TMTV0 increased (R2 5 0.41, P {\textgreater} .0001). A high AUC in cycle 1 (≥9400 mg × h per liter) was associated withbetter response (oddsratio, 5.56;P5.0006) and longerPFS(hazard ratio [HR], 0.38;P5.011) andOS(HR, 0.17;P5.001). A nomogram for rituximab dose needed to obtain optimal AUC according to TMTV0 was constructed, and the 375 mg/m2 classical dose would be suitable for patients with TMTV0 {\textless}281 cm3. In summary, rituximab exposure is influenced by TMTV0 and correlates with response and outcome of DLBCL patients. Dose individualization according to TMTV0 should be evaluated in prospective studies. These studies were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as {\#}NCT00498043 and {\#}NCT00841945.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This phase 1 study evaluated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of cetuximab on patients with epithelial malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Following a skin and tumor biopsy, patients with advanced epithelial malignancies were randomized to receive a single dose of cetuximab at 50, 100, 250, 400, or 500 mg/m2 i.v. Repeat skin (days 2, 8, 15, and 22) and tumor (day 8) biopsies were obtained. Immunohistochemical expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its pathway members was done on biopsies. Blood samples were obtained over 22 days for pharmacokinetic analyses. After day 22, all patients received weekly 250 mg/m2 cetuximab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients enrolled. Rash was noted in 26 (67{\%}) patients. Three patients (two with colon cancer and one with laryngeal cancer) achieved a partial response and 13 patients had stable disease. Pharmacokinetic data revealed mean maximum observed cetuximab concentrations and mean area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 400 mg/m2 cetuximab. Mean clearance was similar at cetuximab doses{\textgreater}or=100 mg/m2, supporting saturation of EGFR binding at 250 mg/m2. Pharmacodynamic evaluation revealed that patients with partial response/stable disease had a higher-grade rash and higher cetuximab trough levels than those with progressive disease (P=0.032 and 0.002, respectively). Administration of single doses (250-500 mg/m2) of cetuximab resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in EGFR protein expression levels in skin over time, supporting a minimal dose of cetuximab at 250 mg/m2 for a pharmacodynamic effect. CONCLUSION: This study provides a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic rationale for the dosing of cetuximab.},

abstract = {The quantitative relationship between neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding affinity at both acidic and physiological pH and the pharmacokinetics of protein engineered FcRn IgG1 variants has not yet been reported. Our objective was to develop a quantitatively mechanism-based competitive binding model to describe the effects of FcRn binding affinity at acidic and physiological pH on the pharmacokinetics of anti-VEGF IgG1 antibodies when both endogenous and exogenous antibodies are competing for the same FcRn. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and FcRn binding data from five Fc variants of humanized anti-VEGF IgG1 monoclonal antibodies with wide range of FcRn binding affinity were used for the analysis. Sixty-seven anti-VEGF IgG1 antibody-treated animals and 25 control animals with simulated endogenous IgG levels were used to develop the final model. A hybrid iterative two stages and Monte Carlo parametric expectation-maximization method was used to obtain the final model parameters estimates. The final model well described the observed PK data. Quantitative FcRn binding affinity-pharmacokinetics relationships was constructed to provide important biological insights in better understanding of the FcRn binding effect on pharmacokinetics of anti-VEGF IgG1 antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys and served as an important model-based drug discovery platform to guide the design and development of the future generation of anti-VEGF or other therapeutic IgG1 antibodies.},

It is being investigated as a potential therapy for locally advanced or metastatic malignancies. The purpose of the study reported here was to characterize the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tissue distribution and tumor penetration of MPDL3280A and/or a chimeric anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO304397 to help further clinical development. The pharmacokinetics of MPDL3280A in monkeys at 0.5, 5 and 20 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1) and the pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics of PRO304397 in mice at 1, 3 10 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1) were determined after a single intravenous dose. Tissue distribution and tumor penetration for radiolabeled PRO304397 in tumor-bearing mouse models were determined. The pharmacokinetics of MPDL3280A and PRO304397 were nonlinear in monkeys and mice, respectively. Complete saturation of PD-L1 in blood in mice was achieved at serum concentrations of PRO304397 above ∼0.5 µg{\textperiodcentered}mL(-1). Tissue distribution and tumor penetration studies of PRO304397 in tumor-bearing mice indicated that the minimum tumor interstitial to plasma radioactivity ratio was ∼0.3; saturation of target-mediated uptake in non-tumor tissues and desirable exposure in tumors were achieved at higher serum concentrations, and the distribution into tumors was dose-and time-dependent. The biodistribution data indicated that the efficacious dose is mostly likely higher than that estimated based on simple pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in blood. These data also allowed for estimation of the target clinical dose for further development of MPDL3280A.},

The population pharmacokinetics of intravenous ofatumumab were characterized in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, and rheumatoid arthritis, diseases with widely varying CD20(+) B-cell counts in blood. Serum concentration data from a total of 477 patients who received ofatumumab doses ranging from 100 mg to 2000 mg in different dosing regimens were analyzed to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ofatumumab across different patient groups and to identify factors contributing to the pharmacokinetic variability. Ofatumumab pharmacokinetics were well described by a linear two-compartment model component to represent non-specific monoclonal antibody clearance from the central compartment interacting with a model component representing the target-mediated clearance of ofatumumab by binding to CD20 expressed on B cells. The clearance (7.5 mL/h) and steady-state volume of distribution (5.3 L) for the linear, non-specific component were consistent with results obtained for other monoclonal antibodies. The target-mediated clearance component was related to the disease-specific number of circulating B cells, which will allow simulation of the contribution of target-mediated clearance to ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in untested disease states with data on B-cell counts and turnover.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The CD20 antigen is expressed on more than 90{\%} of B-cell lymphomas. It is appealing for targeted therapy, because it does not shed or modulate. A chimeric monoclonal antibody more effectively mediates host effector functions and is itself less immunogenic than are murine antibodies. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a multiinstitutional trial of the chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, IDEC-C2B8. Patients with relapsed low grade or follicular lymphoma received an outpatient treatment course of IDEC-C2B8 375 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for four doses. RESULTS From 31 centers, 166 patients were entered. Of this intent-to-treat group, 48{\%} responded. With a median follow-up duration of 11.8 months, the projected median time to progression for responders is 13.0 months. Serum antibody levels were sustained longer after the fourth infusion than after the first, and were higher in responders and in patients with lower tumor burden. The majority of adverse events occurred during the first infusion and were grade 1 or 2; fever and chills were the most common events. Only 12{\%} of patients had grade 3 and 3{\%} grade 4 toxicities. A human antichimeric antibody was detected in only one patient. CONCLUSION The response rate of 48{\%} with IDEC-C2B8 is comparable to results with single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy. Toxicity was mild. Attention needs to be paid to the rate of antibody infusion, with titration according to toxicity. Further investigation of this agent is warranted, including its use in conjunction with standard chemotherapy.},

@article{Ryman2017,
abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (MOABs) are, due to their specificity, increasingly being deployed for therapeutic purposes. MOABs are derived from immunoglobulins and are fully or partially of murine or human origin. They are administered parenterally: mostly intravenously, but subcutaneous or intramuscular administration is also possible, in which case absorption probably occurs through the lymphatic system. The distribution of MOABs from the bloodstream into the tissues is slow and is hampered by the high molecular size of the MOABs, which is a lesser problem for fragments of antibodies (Fab fragments). MOABs are metabolised to peptides and amino acids. This process takes place in many tissues of the body, but probably predominantly in epithelial cells. As a consequence of the saturable binding of the MOAB to its target, a dose-dependent (non-linear) elimination is often observed. Immune reactions can accelerate the elimination of antibodies, partially depending on the degree ofhumanisation of the antibody. Antibodies and endogenous immunoglobulins are protected from elimination by binding to protective receptors (neonatal Fc-receptor; FcRn), which explains their long half-lives (up to 4 weeks). Metabolic pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs have not been reported and are not expected. It is expected that in the years to come, new MOABs directed towards new targets will appear on the market, as well as existing antibodies with improved pharmacokinetic properties.},

It has been shown to induce and maintain both clinical remission and mucosal healing in pediatric and adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are unresponsive or refractory to conventional therapies. The administration of infliximab is weight-based and the drug is administered intravenously. The volume of distribution of infliximab is low and at steady state ranges from 4.5 to 6 L. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, such as immunoglobulins, are cleared from the circulation primarily by catabolism. Median infliximab half-life is approximately 14 days. Infliximab concentration-time data in patients with CD and UC have been shown to be highly variable within an individual patient over time and between individuals by multiple population pharmacokinetic models. Covariates that have been identified to account for a part of the observed inter- and intra-individual variability in clearance are the presence of antidrug antibodies, use of concomitant immunomodulators, degree of systemic inflammation, serum albumin concentration, and body weight, which can affect the pharmacodynamic response. This article provides a comprehensive review of the clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of infliximab, as well as the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in the treatment of IBD.},

abstract = {The soluble cytokine TNF-$\alpha$ is an important target for many therapeutic proteins used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Biologics targeting TNF-$\alpha$ exert their pharmacological effects through binding and neutralizing this cytokine and preventing it from binding to its cell surface receptors. The magnitude of their pharmacological effects directly corresponds to the extent and duration of free TNF-$\alpha$ suppression. However, endogenous TNF-$\alpha$ is of low abundance and therefore it is quite challenging to assess the free TNF-$\alpha$ suppression experimentally. Here we have applied an experimental approach to bypass this difficulty by giving the studied animals rhTNF-$\alpha$ through SC infusion. This boosted TNF-$\alpha$ enabled quantification of TNF-$\alpha$ in plasma. Free rhTNF-$\alpha$ concentrations were measured after separation from the infliximab-rhTNF-$\alpha$ complex using Dynabeads Protein A. The interrelationship of infliximab and TNF-$\alpha$ was assessed with minimal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) models for TNF-$\alpha$ and infliximab with a target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) component. Knowledge of TNF-$\alpha$ PK allows reliable prediction of the free TNF-$\alpha$ suppression with either free or total TNF-$\alpha$ concentration profiles. The experimental and modeling approaches in the present study may aid in the development of next-generation TNF-$\alpha$ inhibitors with improved therapeutic effects.},

abstract = {The predominant driver of bioanalysis in supporting drug development is the intended use of the data. Ligand-binding assays (LBA) are widely used for the analysis of protein biotherapeutics and target ligands (L) to support pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and safety assessments. For monoclonal antibody drugs (mAb), in particular, which non-covalently bind to L, multiple forms of mAb and L can exist in vivo, including free mAb, free L, and mono- and/or bivalent complexes of mAb and L. Given the complexity of the dynamic binding equilibrium occurring in the body after dosing and multiple sources of perturbation of the equilibrium during bioanalysis, it is clear that ex vivo quantification of the forms of interest (free, bound, or total mAb and L) may differ from the actual ones in vivo. LBA reagents and assay formats can be designed in principle to measure the total or free forms of mAb and L. However, confirmation of the forms being measured under the specified conditions can be technically challenging. The assay forms and issues must be clearly communicated and understood appropriately by all stakeholders as the program proceeds through the development process. This paper focuses on monoclonal antibody biotherapeutics and their circulatory L that are either secreted as soluble forms or shed from membrane receptors. It presents an investigation into the theoretical and practical considerations for total/free analyte assessment to increase awareness in the scientific community and offer bioanalytical approaches to provide appropriate PK/PD information required at specific phases of drug development.},

abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a primary mediator of inflammatory responses, is increased in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD) and considered to play an important role in the regulation of inflammation in CD. Infliximab (IFX) is a chimeric murine-human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that targets TNF-alpha and is used as a therapeutic agent for CD. Although that dosage regimen has been established through clinical trial experience, it has not been analyzed theoretically. We analyzed of sequential changes of the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) using a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model integrating the pharmacokinetics of IFX and turnover rate of TNF-alpha. The time course effects of IFX derived from the present model were matched to reported data regarding CDAI ratios, and we found that the clinical effect of IFX reached a maximum value 2 to 4 weeks after administration and was maintained for the next several weeks. Our results suggested that the standard dosage regimen of IFX is theoretically appropriate. Further, based on the results of various dosage regimens, a second administration of IFX 2 weeks after the first dose was shown to achieve remission in the early stage of active CD, when IFX was given as a repeated treatment.},

abstract = {WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: The concentration-effect relationship of rituximab in follicular lymphoma (FL) was previously described using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling. The influence of genetic polymorphism of FCGR3A on rituximab efficacy in FL patients was included in this PK-PD model. Previous studies suggest that increasing the dose of rituximab and/or the number of infusions may lead to a better clinical response in FL.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The previously validated PK-PD model can be used to design an optimized rituximab dose regimen in FL patients. Clinical trial simulation shows the potential clinical benefits of changes in rituximab dose. Optimization of the rituximab dose regimen cannot compensate for the lower response of FCGR3A-158F carriers compared with that of FCGR3A-158VV patients. AIMS Rituximab has dramatically improved the survival of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, studies have suggested that the dose regimen currently used (i.e. 375 mg m(-2) ) could be optimized. The aims of this study were to quantify the benefits of the new dose regimen for rituximab in follicular NHL (FL) patients using a previously validated PK-PD model and to design clinical trials investigating optimization of rituximab dosage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A PK-PD model was used to predict progression-free survival (PFS) of FL patients treated by rituximab alone in asymptomatic FL, and those treated by rituximab combined with chemotherapy (R-CHOP) in relapsed/resistant FL. This model accounts for the influence of a polymorphism in FCGR3A, the gene encoding the Fc$\gamma$RIIIa receptor, on clinical efficacy. Several induction and maintenance dose regimens using rituximab alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy (CHOP) were tested. The benefits of rituximab dose adjustment for F carriers were investigated. The numbers of subjects required for the design of two-armed clinical trials were calculated using model-predicted PFS at a power of 80{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The model predicted a potential benefit of 1500 mg m(-2) maintenance doses of rituximab for both rituximab monotherapy and R-CHOP. The model shows that the PFS of FCGR3A-F carriers remains lower than that of homozygous FCGR3A-VV patients, even with markedly increased rituximab doses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest a benefit of increasing doses of rituximab in FL, both during induction and maintenance. These results need to be confirmed in controlled clinical trials.},

abstract = {AIMS: To characterize alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics and its exposure-response relationship with white blood cell (WBC) count in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). METHODS: Nonlinear mixed effects models were used to characterize plasma concentration-time data and WBC count-time data from 67 patients. Logistic regression was used to relate summary measures of drug exposure to tumour response. RESULTS: Alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics were best characterized by a two-compartment model with nonlinear elimination where V(max) (microg h(-1)) was [1020 x (WBC count/10 x 10(9) l(-1))(0.194)], K(m) was 338 microg l(-1), V(1) was 11.3 l, Q was 1.05 l h(-1) and V(2) was 41.5 l. Intersubject variability (ISV) in V(max), K(m), V(1) and V(2) was 32{\%}, 145{\%}, 84{\%} and 179{\%}, respectively. The reduction in WBC over time was modelled by a stimulatory loss indirect response model with values of 18.2 for E(max), 306 microg l(-1) for EC(50), 1.56 x 10(9) cells l(-1) h(-1) for K(in) and 0.029 per h for K(out). The probability of achieving a complete or partial response was {\textgreater}/=50{\%} when the maximal trough concentration exceeded 13.2 microg ml(-1) or when AUC(0-tau) exceeded 484 microg h(-1) ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS: Alemtuzumab displayed time- and concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics with large interpatient variability, both in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which was probably reflective of differences in tumour burden among patients. A direct relationship between maximal trough concentrations and clinical outcomes was observed, with increasing alemtuzumab exposure resulting in a greater probability of positive tumour response.},

abstract = {Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the CD20 antigen on B cells are successfully used in the clinic for the depletion of B cells to treat various forms of cancer and autoimmune diseases. The first CD20 mAb, approved by the FDA in 1998, was rituximab (RTX) and since then it has been widely used to treat more than one million patients thus far. The success of RTX has led to a general interest in the mechanism of action of CD20 mAbs. CD20 mAbs can induce tumor killing via various mechanisms, such as direct induction of apoptosis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent lysis (CDC). Although we now understand these mechanisms better, it is still unclear which of these mechanisms is the most important for in vivo RTX action. Not every patient respond to RTX treatment and eventually the overwhelming majority will experience a relapse. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the efficacy of CD20 mAbs. This review aims to summarize our current understanding on the mechanism of action of CD20 mAbs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Poor distribution of some anticancer drugs in solid tumors may limit their anti-tumor activity. METHODS Here we used immunohistochemistry to quantify the distribution of the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and trastuzumab in relation to blood vessels and to regions of hypoxia in human tumor xenografts. The antibodies were injected into mice implanted with human epidermoid carcinoma A431 or human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 transfected with ERBB2 (231-H2N) that express high levels of ErbB1 and ErbB2 respectively, or wild-type MDA-MB-231, which expresses intermediate levels of ErbB1 and low levels of ErbB2. RESULTS The distribution of cetuximab in A431 xenografts and trastuzumab in 231-H2N xenografts was time and dose dependent. At early intervals after injection of 1 mg cetuximab into A431 xenografts, the concentration of cetuximab decreased with increasing distance from blood vessels, but became more uniformly distributed at later times; there remained however limited distribution and binding in hypoxic regions of tumors. Injection of lower doses of cetuximab led to heterogeneous distributions. Similar results were observed with trastuzumab in 231-H2N xenografts. In MDA-MB-231 xenografts, which express lower levels of ErbB1, homogeneity of distribution of cetuximab was achieved more rapidly. CONCLUSIONS Cetuximab and trastuzumab distribute slowly, but at higher doses achieve a relatively uniform distribution after about 24 hours, most likely due to their long half-lives in the circulation. There remains poor distribution within hypoxic regions of tumors.},

abstract = {The ability to predict subcutaneous (SC) absorption rate and tissue distribution of therapeutic proteins (TPs) using a bottom-up approach is highly desirable early in the drug development process prior to clinical data being available. A whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, requiring only a few drug parameters, to predict plasma and interstitial fluid concentrations of TPs in humans after intravenous and subcutaneous dosing has been developed. Movement of TPs between vascular and interstitial spaces was described by considering both convection and diffusion processes using a 2-pore framework. The model was optimised using a variety of literature sources, such as tissue lymph/plasma concentration ratios in humans and animals, information on the percentage of dose absorbed following SC dosing via lymph in animals and data showing loss of radiolabelled IgG from the SC dosing site in humans. The resultant model was used to predict t max and plasma concentration profiles for 12 TPs (molecular weight 8-150 kDa) following SC dosing. The predicted plasma concentration profiles were generally comparable to observed data. t max was predicted within 3-fold of reported values, with one third of the predictions within 0.8-1.25-fold. There was no systematic bias in simulated C max values, although a general trend for underprediction of t max was observed. No clear trend between prediction accuracy of t max and TP isoelectric point or molecular size was apparent. The mechanistic whole-body PBPK model described here can be applied to predict absorption rate of TPs into blood and movement into target tissues following SC dosing.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, a mathematical modeling approach which uses a pharmacokinetic model to mimick human physiology to predict drug concentration-time profiles, has been used for the discover and development of drugs in various fields, including oncology, since 2000. There have been a few general review articles on the utilization of PBPK in the development of oncology drugs, but these do not include an evaluation of model prediction accuracy. We therefore conducted a systematic review to define the accuracy of PBPK model prediction and its utility throughout all the developmental phases of oncology drugs. METHODS A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, PubMed Central and Cochrane Library databases from 1980 to February 2017 for articles (1) written in English, (2) focused on oncology or antineoplastic or anticancer drugs, tumor or cancer or anticancer drugs listed in the U.S. National Institutes of Health and (3) involving a PBPK model. The absolute-average-folding-errors (AAFEs) of the area under the curve (AUC) between predicted and observed values in each article were calculated to assess model prediction accuracy. RESULTS Of the 2341 articles initially identified by our search of the databases, 40 were included in the review analysis. These articles reported on six types of studies, i.e. in vivo (n = 4), first-in-human (n = 5), phase II/III clinical trials (n = 9), organ impairment (n = 3), pediatrics (n = 4) and drug-drug interactions (n = 15). AAFEs of the predicted AUC for all groups of studies were within 1.3-fold of each other despite variations in experimental methodologies. CONCLUSION PBPK modeling is a potential tool which can be effectively applied throughout all phases of oncology drug development. The number of experimental animals and human participants enrolled in the studies can be reduced using PBPK modeling and PBPK-population-PK modeling. The limited number of publications of unsuccessful model application to date may contribute to bias toward the usefulness of modeling.},

abstract = {All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is a front-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Due to its activity in regulating the cell cycle, it has also been evaluated for the treatment of other cancers. However, the efficacy of atRA has been limited by atRA inducing its own metabolism during therapy, resulting in a decrease of atRA exposure during continuous dosing. Frequent relapse occurs in patients receiving atRA monotherapy. In an attempt to combat therapy resistance, inhibitors of atRA metabolism have been developed. Of these, ketoconazole and liarozole have shown some benefits, but their usage is limited by side effects and low potency toward the cytochrome P450 26A1 isoform (CYP26A1), the main atRA hydroxylase. We determined the pharmacokinetic basis of therapy resistance to atRA and tested whether the complex disposition kinetics of atRA could be predicted in healthy subjects and in cancer patients in the presence and absence of inhibitors of atRA metabolism using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. A PBPK model of atRA disposition was developed and verified in healthy individuals and in cancer patients. The population-based PBPK model of atRA disposition incorporated saturable metabolic clearance of atRA, induction of CYP26A1 by atRA, and the absorption and distribution kinetics of atRA. It accurately predicted the changes in atRA exposure after continuous dosing and when coadministered with ketoconazole and liarozole. The developed model will be useful in interpretation of atRA disposition and efficacy, design of novel dosing strategies, and development of next-generation atRA metabolism inhibitors.},

abstract = {Combination chemotherapy represents the standard-of-care for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, the development of new therapeutic regimens is empirical and this approach cannot be used prospectively to identify novel or optimal drug combinations. Quantitative system pharmacodynamic models could promote the discovery and development of combination regimens based upon first principles. In this study, we developed a mathematical model that integrates temporal patterns of drug exposure, receptor occupancy, and signal transduction to predict the effects of the CD20 agonist rituximab in combination with rhApo2L/TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand or fenretinide, a cytotoxic retinoid, upon growth kinetics in non-Hodgkin lymphoma xenografts. The model recapitulated major regulatory mechanisms, including target-mediated disposition of rituximab, modulation of proapoptotic intracellular signaling induced by CD20 occupancy, and the relative efficacy of death receptor isoforms. The multiscale model coupled tumor responses to individual anticancer agents with their mechanisms of action in vivo, and the changes in Bcl-xL and Fas induced by CD20 occupancy were linked to explain the synergy of these drugs. Tumor growth profiles predicted by the model agreed with cell and xenograft data, capturing the apparent pharmacologic synergy of these agents with fidelity. Together, our findings provide a mechanism-based platform for exploring new regimens with CD20 agonists.},

abstract = {Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a lysosomotropic autophagy inhibitor being used in over 50 clinical trials either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies with HCQ have shown that drug exposure in the blood does not correlate with autophagy inhibition in either peripheral blood mononuclear cells or tumor tissue. To better explain this PK/PD disconnect, a PBPK was developed for HCQ describing the tissue-specific absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion as well as lysosome-specific sequestration. Using physiologic and biochemical parameters derived from literature or obtained experimentally, the model was first developed and validated in mice, and then adapted to simulate human HCQ exposure in whole blood and urine through allometric scaling and species-specific parameter modification. The human model accurately simulated average steady-state concentrations (Css) of those observed in five different HCQ combination clinical trials across seven different doses, which was then expanded by comparison of the Css distribution in a virtual human population at this range of doses. Value of this model lies in its ability to simulate HCQ PK in patients while accounting for PK modification by combination treatment modalities, drug concentrations at the active site in the lysosome under varying pH conditions, and exposure in tissues where toxicity is observed.},

A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was constructed and verified for dabrafenib. This model was then used to evaluate the physiological and molecular characteristics driving BSV in dabrafenib exposure. The capacity to discriminate a steady state dabrafenib trough concentration {\textgreater}48ng/mL was also evaluated. The mean simulated/observed ratios for the parameters describing dabrafenib exposure in single-dose, multiple-dose and drug-drug interaction studies were between 0.78 and 1.23. Multivariable analysis indicated that consideration of baseline weight, BMI, and CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and P-gp abundance strongly predicts steady state dabrafenib trough concentration above 48ng/mL (ROC AUC = 0.94; Accuracy = 86{\%}). This is the first study to use a verified PBPK model to identify baseline physiological and molecular characteristics driving BSV in drug exposure. This article is protected by copyright.

Data from four clinical trials of obinutuzumab were analyzed to describe the PK properties in patients with NHL or CLL and the pharmacodynamic (PD) properties in patients with CLL. A population PK model with linear time-dependent clearance described the obinutuzumab concentration-time course. Diagnosis, baseline tumor size (BSIZ), body weight, and gender were the main covariates affecting obinutuzumab exposure. In patients with CLL, exposure was not associated with safety but showed positive trends of correlation with efficacy. Although efficacy correlated positively with exposure, since both efficacy and exposure correlated negatively with BSIZ, it was not possible to determine with certainty whether it would be beneficial to adjust the dose according to BSIZ.},

The population pharmacokinetics of intravenous ofatumumab were characterized in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, and rheumatoid arthritis, diseases with widely varying CD20(+) B-cell counts in blood. Serum concentration data from a total of 477 patients who received ofatumumab doses ranging from 100 mg to 2000 mg in different dosing regimens were analyzed to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ofatumumab across different patient groups and to identify factors contributing to the pharmacokinetic variability. Ofatumumab pharmacokinetics were well described by a linear two-compartment model component to represent non-specific monoclonal antibody clearance from the central compartment interacting with a model component representing the target-mediated clearance of ofatumumab by binding to CD20 expressed on B cells. The clearance (7.5 mL/h) and steady-state volume of distribution (5.3 L) for the linear, non-specific component were consistent with results obtained for other monoclonal antibodies. The target-mediated clearance component was related to the disease-specific number of circulating B cells, which will allow simulation of the contribution of target-mediated clearance to ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in untested disease states with data on B-cell counts and turnover.},

abstract = {AIMS Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies suggest that there is a room for improvement in clinical use of rituximab through more individualized treatment. The objective of this study was to characterize rituximab PK in 29 newly diagnosed patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and methylprednisolone every 3 weeks. We also evaluated the association of rituximab PK with clinical outcome. METHODS Rituximab serum levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and evaluated by a population PK analysis applying nonlinear mixed effects modelling. RESULTS The data were best described by a two-compartment model comprising linear nonspecific clearance of 0.252 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.227-0.279] l day-1 and time-varying specific clearance of 0.278 (95{\%} CI: 0.181-0.390) l day-1 , corresponding to target-mediated drug disposition of rituximab. Nonspecific clearance was lower in older patients and those with lower body weight. Additionally, volume of the central compartment was higher in males. A clear association of clinical response with rituximab PK has been observed. Rate constant of specific clearance decay was 0.143 day-1 (95{\%} CI: 0.0478-0.418) in patients with no disease progression, while in patients with disease progression it was 82.2{\%} lower (95{\%} CI: 33.4-95.0). CONCLUSIONS This finding indicates that time-changes in clearance could serve as a predictive marker of response to rituximab. Our report demonstrates the rationale for studies evaluating higher doses of rituximab in selected patients.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists. We proposed here a minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) model for a group of novel engineered antibodies in mice and humans. These antibodies are designed with altered binding properties of their Fc domain with neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) or the Fab domain with their cognate targets (recycling antibodies) in acidic endosomes. To enable simulations of such binding features in the change of antibody pharmacokinetics and its target suppression, we nested an endothelial endosome compartment in parallel with plasma compartment based on our previously established mPBPK model. The fluid-phase pinocytosis rate from plasma to endothelial endosomes was reflected by the clearance of antibodies in FcRn dysfunctional humans or FcRn-knockout mice. The endosomal recycling rate of FcRn-bound antibodies was calculated based on the reported endosomal transit time. The nonspecific catabolism in endosomes was fitted using pharmacokinetic data of a human wild-type IgG 1 adalimumab in humans and B21M in human FcRn (hFcRn) transgenic mice. The developed model adequately predicted the pharmacokinetics of infliximab, motavizumab, and an Fc variant of motavizumab in humans and the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab, an Fc variant of bevacizumab, and a recycling antibody PH-IgG 1 and its non-pH dependent counterpart NPH-IgG 1 in hFcRn transgenic mice. Our proposed model provides a platform for evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and disposition behaviors of Fc-engineered antibodies and recycling antibodies.},

abstract = {Many clinically approved and investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapeutics are directed against proteins located in the systemic circulation, including cytokines, growth factors, lymphocyte proteins, and shed antigens. Interaction between mAb and target may lead to non-linear pharmacokinetics (PK), characterized by rapid, target-mediated elimination. Several groups have reported that determinants of target-mediated elimination could include mAb-target binding, target expression, and target turnover. Recently, we scaled a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for mAb disposition to man and used it to predict the non-linear PK of mAbs directed against tumor epithelial proteins. In this work, we extended the previously described model to account for the influence of lymphocyte proteins on mAb PK in man. To account for the dynamic behavior of lymphocytes in the circulation, lymphocyte cycling between blood and lymphoid organs was described using first-order transfer rate constants. Use of lymphocyte cycling and reported target turnover rates in the model allowed the accurate prediction of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 4 mAbs (TRX1, MTRX1011a, rituximab, daclizumab) directed against 3 lymphocyte targets (CD4, CD20, CD25). The results described here suggest that the proposed model structure may be useful in the a priori prediction of the PK/PD properties of mAbs directed against antigens in the circulation.},

We present a modeling framework which includes the systemic distribution, vascular permeability, inter-stitial transport, as well as binding and payload release kinetics of ADC-therapeutic agents in mouse xenografts. We focused, in particular, on receptor dynamics such as endocytic trafficking mechanisms within cancer cells, to simulate their impact on tumor mass shrinkage upon ADC administration. Our model identified undesirable tumor properties that can impair ADC tissue homogeneity, further compromising ADC success, and explored ADC design optimization scenarios to counteract upon such unfavorable intrinsic tumor tissue attributes. We further demonstrated the profound impact of cytotoxic payload release mechanisms and the role of bystander killing effects on tumor shrinkage. This model platform affords a customizable simulation environment which can aid with experimental data interpretation and the design of ADC therapeutic treatments.},

abstract = {Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are ushering in the next era of targeted therapy against cancer. An ADC for cancer therapy consists of a potent cytotoxic payload that is attached to a tumour-targeted antibody by a chemical linker, usually with an average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 3.5-4. The theory is to deliver potent cytotoxic payloads directly to tumour cells while sparing healthy cells. However, practical application has proven to be more difficult. At present there are only two ADCs approved for clinical use. Nevertheless, in the last decade there has been an explosion of options for ADC engineering to optimize target selection, Fc receptor interactions, linker, payload and more. Evaluation of these strategies requires an understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of ADC pharmacoki-netics. Development of ADCs for use in cancer further requires an understanding of tumour properties and kinetics within the tumour environment, and how the presence of cancer as a disease will impact distribution and elimination. Key pharmacokinetic considerations for the successful design and clinical application of ADCs in oncology are explored in this review, with a focus on the mechanistic determinants of distribution and elimination.},

abstract = {The pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior of monoclonal antibod-ies in cynomolgus monkeys (cynos) is generally translatable to that in humans. Unfortunately, about 39{\%} of the antibodies evaluated for PKs in cynos have fast nonspecific (or non-target-mediated) clearance (in-house data). An empirical model relating variable region (Fv) charge and hydrophobicity to cyno non-specific clearance was developed to gauge the risk an antibody would have for fast nonspecific clearance in the monkey. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictability of this empirical model on cyno nonspecific clearance with antibod-ies specifically engineered to have either high or low Fv charge. These amino acid changes were made in the Fv region of two test antibodies, humAb4D5-8 and anti-lymphotoxin. The humAb4D5-8 has a typical nonspecific clearance in cynos, and by making it more positively charged, the antibody acquires fast nonspecific clearance, and making it less positively charged did not impact its clearance. Anti-lymphotoxin has fast nonspe-cific clearance in cynos, and making it more positively charged caused it to clear even faster, whereas making it less positively charged caused it to clear slower and within the typical range. These trends in clearance were also observed in two other pre-clinical species, mice and rats. The effect of modifying Fv charge on subcutaneous bioavailability was also examined, and in general bioavailability was inversely related to the direction of the Fv charge change. Thus, modifying Fv charge appears to impact antibody PKs, and the changes tended to correlate with those predicted by the empirical model.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate model identifiability when minimal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) models are integrated with target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) models in the tissue compartment. Three quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximations of TMDD dynamics were explored: on (a) antibody-target complex, (b) free target, and (c) free antibody concentrations in tissue. The effects of the QSS approximations were assessed via simulations, taking as reference the mPBPK-TMDD model with no simplifications. Approximation (a) did not affect model-derived concentrations, while with the inclusion of approximation (b) or (c), target concentration profiles alone, or both drug and target concentration profiles respectively deviated from the reference model profiles. A local sensitivity analysis was performed, highlighting the potential importance of sampling in the terminal pharmacokinetic phase and of collecting target concentration data. The a priori and a posteriori identifiability of the mPBPK-TMDD models were investigated under different experimental scenarios and designs. The reference model and QSS approximation (a) on antibody-target complex were both found to be a priori identifiable in all scenarios, while under the further inclusion of QSS approximation (b) target concentration data were needed for a priori identifiability to be preserved. The property could not be assessed for the model including all three QSS approximations. A posteriori identifiability issues were detected for all models, although improvement was observed when appropriate sampling and dose range were selected. In conclusion, this work provides a theoretical framework for the assessment of key properties of mathematical models before their experimental application. Attention should be paid when applying integrated mPBPK-TMDD models, as identifiability issues do exist, especially when rich study designs are not feasible.},

abstract = {The objectives of this retrospective analysis were (1) to characterize the population pharmacokinetics (popPK) of four different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a combined analysis of individual data collected during first-in-human (FIH) studies and (2) to provide a scientific rationale for prospective design of FIH studies with mAbs. The data set was composed of 171 subjects contributing a total of 2716 mAb serum concentrations, following intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) doses. mAb PK was described by an open 2-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment and a depot compartment with first-order absorption. Parameter values obtained from the popPK model were further used to generate optimal sampling times for a single dose study. A robust fit to the combined data from four mAbs was obtained using the 2-compartment model. Population parameter estimates for systemic clearance and central volume of distribution were 0.20 L/day and 3.6 L with intersubject variability of 31{\%} and 34{\%}, respectively. The random residual error was 14{\%}. Differences ({\textgreater} 2-fold) in PK parameters were not apparent across mAbs. Rich designs (22 samples/subject), minimal designs for popPK (5 samples/subject), and optimal designs for non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and popPK (10 samples/subject) were examined by stochastic simulation and estimation. Single-dose PK studies for linear mAbs executed using the optimal designs are expected to yield high-quality model estimates, and accurate capture of NCA estimations. This model-based meta-analysis has determined typical popPK values for four mAbs with linear elimination and enabled prospective optimization of FIH study designs, potentially improving the efficiency of FIH studies for this class of therapeutics.},

abstract = {The objectives of the following investigation were (1) development of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model capable of characterizing the plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics (PK) of nonspecific or antigen specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in wild type, FcRn knockout, tumor bearing and non tumor bearing mice and (2) evaluation of the scale up potential of the model by characterizing the mouse, rat, monkey and human plasma PK of mAbs, simultaneously. A PBPK model containing 15 tissues, a carcass and a tumor compartment was developed by modifying/augmenting previously published PBPK models. Each tissue compartment was subdivided into plasma, blood cell, endothelial, interstitial and cellular sub-compartments. Each tissue was connected through blood and lymph flow to the systemic circulation. Lymph flow was set to a value 500 times lower than plasma flow and vascular reflection coefficients for each tissue were adjusted according to their vascular pore size. In each tissue endothelial space, mAb entered via pinocytosis and the interaction of FcRn with mAb was described by on and off rates. FcRn bound mAb was recycled and unbound mAb was eliminated by a first order process (K(deg)). The PBPK model was simultaneously fit to the following datasets to estimate four system parameters: (1) plasma and tissue PK of nonspecific mAb in wild type mouse with or without simultaneous intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration, (2) plasma and tissue PK of nonspecific mAb in FcRn knockout mouse, (3) plasma and tissue PK of nonspecific mAb in tumor bearing mouse, (4) plasma and tissue PK of tumor antigen specific mAb in tumor bearing mouse, and (5) plasma PK of mAb in rat, monkey and human. The model was able to characterize all the datasets reasonably well with a common set of parameters. The estimated value of the four system parameters i.e. FcRn concentration (FcRn), rate of pinocytosis per unit endosomal space (CL(up)), K(deg) and the proportionality constant (C{\_}LNLF) between the rate at which antibody transfers from the lymph node compartment to the blood compartment and the plasma flow of the given species, were found to be 4.98E-05 M (CV{\%} = 11.1), 3.66E-02 l/h/l ({\%}CV = 3.48), 42.9 1/h ({\%}CV = 15.7) and 9.1 (CV{\%} {\textgreater} 50). Thus, a platform PBPK model has been developed that can not only simultaneously characterize mAb disposition data obtained from various previously published mouse PBPK models but is also capable of characterizing mAb disposition in various preclinical species and human.},

abstract = {Systems pharmacokinetic (PK) models that can characterize and predict whole body disposition of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are needed to support (i) development of reliable exposure-response relationships for ADCs and (ii) selection of ADC targets with optimal tumor and tissue expression profiles. Towards this goal, we have developed a translational physiologically based PK (PBPK) model for ADCs, using T-DM1 as a tool compound. The preclinical PBPK model was developed using rat data. Biodistribution of DM1 in rats was used to develop the small molecule PBPK model, and the PK of conjugated trastuzumab (i.e., T-DM1) in rats was characterized using platform PBPK model for antibody. Both the PBPK models were combined via degradation and deconjugation processes. The degradation of conjugated antibody was assumed to be similar to a normal antibody, and the deconjugation of DM1 from T-DM1 in rats was estimated using plasma PK data. The rat PBPK model was translated to humans to predict clinical PK of T-DM1. The translation involved the use of human antibody PBPK model to characterize the PK of conjugated trastuzumab, use of allometric scaling to predict human clearance of DM1 catabolites, and use of monkey PK data to predict deconjugation of DM1 in the clinic. PBPK model-predicted clinical PK profiles were compared with clinically observed data. The PK of total trastuzumab and T-DM1 were predicted reasonably well, and slight systemic deviations were observed for the PK of DM1-containing catabolites. The ADC PBPK model presented here can serve as a platform to develop models for other ADCs.},

abstract = {Many clinically approved and investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapeutics are directed against proteins located in the systemic circulation, including cytokines, growth factors, lymphocyte proteins, and shed antigens. Interaction between mAb and target may lead to non-linear pharmacokinetics (PK), characterized by rapid, target-mediated elimination. Several groups have reported that determinants of target-mediated elimination could include mAb-target binding, target expression, and target turnover. Recently, we scaled a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for mAb disposition to man and used it to predict the non-linear PK of mAbs directed against tumor epithelial proteins. In this work, we extended the previously described model to account for the influence of lymphocyte proteins on mAb PK in man. To account for the dynamic behavior of lymphocytes in the circulation, lymphocyte cycling between blood and lymphoid organs was described using first-order transfer rate constants. Use of lymphocyte cycling and reported target turnover rates in the model allowed the accurate prediction of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 4 mAbs (TRX1, MTRX1011a, rituximab, daclizumab) directed against 3 lymphocyte targets (CD4, CD20, CD25). The results described here suggest that the proposed model structure may be useful in the a priori prediction of the PK/PD properties of mAbs directed against antigens in the circulation.},

abstract = {In this study, we examined the effects of target expression , neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expression in tumors, and pH-dependent target binding on the disposition of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in murine models of colorectal cancer. A panel of anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mAbs was developed via standard hybridoma technology and then evaluated for pH-dependent CEA binding. Binding was assessed via immu-noassay and radioligand binding assays. 10H6, a murine IgG1 mAb with high affinity for CEA at pH 5 7.4 (K D 5 12.6 6 1.7 nM) and reduced affinity at pH 5 6.0 (K D 5 144.6 6 21.8 nM), and T84.66, which exhibits pH-independent CEA binding (K D 5 1.1 6 0.11 and 1.4 6 0.16 nM at pH 7.4 and 6.0), were selected for pharmacokinetic investigations. We evaluated pharmacoki-netics after intravenous administration to control mice and to mice bearing tumors with (MC38 CEA1 , LS174T) and without (MC38 CEA2) CEA expression and with or without expression of murine FcRn, at doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg. 10H6 displayed linear pharmacokinetics in mice bearing MC38 CEA1 or MC38 CEA2 tumors. T84.66 displayed linear pharmacoki-netics in mice with MC38 CEA2 tumors but dose-dependent nonlinear pharmacokinetics in mice bearing MC38 CEA1. In addition to the improved plasma pharmacokinetic profile (i.e., linear pharmacokinetics, longer terminal half-life), 10H6 exhibited improved exposure in MC38 CEA1 tumors relative to T84.66. In mice bearing tumors with CEA expression, but lacking expression of murine FcRn (LS174T), 10H6 demonstrated nonlinear pharmacokinetics, with rapid clearance at low dose. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that pH-dependent CEA binding allows mAb dissociation from target in acidified endosomes, enabling FcRn-mediated protection from target-mediated elimination in mice bearing MC38 CEA1 tumors.},

Alteration in the interaction with the recycling FcRn receptor did not account for the faster than expected clearance observed for the antibodies; off-target binding was presumed to account for the fast clearance. We developed an assay based on ELISA detection of non-specific binding to baculovirus particles that can identify antibodies having increased risk for fast clearance. This assay can be used during lead generation or optimization to identify antibodies with increased risk of having fast clearance in both humans and cynomolgus monkeys, and thus increase the likelihood of obtaining a suitable drug candidate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dengue viruses are transmitted by anthropophilic mosquitoes and infect approximately 50 million humans annually. To investigate impacts of future climate change on dengue virus transmission, we investigated bionomics of the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Using a dynamic life table simulation model (the Container inhabiting mosquito simulation CIMSiM) and statistically downscaled daily values for future climate, we assessed climate change induced changes to mosquito bionomics. Simulations of Ae. aegypti populations for current (1991-2011) and future climate (2046-2065) were conducted for the city of Cairns, Queensland, the population centre with most dengue virus transmission in Australia. Female mosquito abundance, wet weight, and the extrinsic incubation period for dengue virus in these mosquitoes were estimated for current and future climate (MPI ECHAM 5 model, B1 and A2 emission scenarios).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall mosquito abundance is predicted to change, but results were equivocal for different climate change scenarios. Aedes aegypti abundance is predicted to increase under the B1, but decrease under the A2 scenario. Mosquitoes are predicted to have a smaller body mass in a future climate. Shorter extrinsic incubation periods are projected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: It is therefore unclear whether dengue risk would increase or decrease in tropical Australia with climate change. Our findings challenge the prevailing view that a future, warmer climate will lead to larger mosquito populations and a definite increase in dengue transmission. Whilst general predictions can be made about future mosquito borne disease incidence, cautious interpretation is necessary due to interaction between local environment, human behaviour and built environment, dengue virus, and vectors.},

abstract = {Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a promising class of cancer therapeutics that combine the specificity of antibodies with the cytotoxic effects of payload drugs. A quantitative understanding of how ADCs are processed intracellularly can illustrate which processing steps most influence payload delivery, thus aiding the design of more effective ADCs. In this work, we develop a kinetic model for ADC cellular processing as well as generalizable methods based on flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging to parameterize this model. A number of key processing steps are included in the model: ADC binding to its target antigen, internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis, proteolytic degradation of the ADC, efflux of the payload out of the cell, and payload binding to its intracellular target. The model was developed with a trastuzumab-maytansinoid ADC (TM-ADC) similar to trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1), which is used in the clinical treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. In three high-HER2-expressing cell lines (BT-474, NCI-N87, and SK-BR-3), we report for TM-ADC half-lives for internalization of 6-14 h, degradation of 18-25 h, and efflux rate of 44-73 h. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the internalization rate and efflux rate are key parameters for determining how much payload is delivered to a cell with TM-ADC. In addition, this model describing the cellular processing of ADCs can be incorporated into larger pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics models, as demonstrated in the associated companion paper.},

abstract = {Antibody-drug conjugates exhibit complex pharmacokinetics due to their combination of macromolecular and small molecule properties. These issues range from systemic concerns, such as deconjugation of the small molecule drug during the long antibody circulation time or rapid clearance from nonspecific interactions, to local tumor tissue heterogeneity, cell bystander effects, and endosomal escape. Mathematical models can be used to study the impact of these processes on overall distribution in an efficient manner, and several types of models have been used to analyze varying aspects of antibody distribution including physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models and tissue-level simulations. However, these processes are quantitative in nature and cannot be handled qualitatively in isolation. For example, free antibody from deconjugation of the small molecule will impact the distribution of conjugated antibodies within the tumor. To incorporate these effects into a unified framework, we have coupled the systemic and organ-level distribution of a PBPK model with the tissue-level detail of a distributed parameter tumor model. We used this mathematical model to analyze new experimental results on the distribution of the clinical antibody-drug conjugate Kadcyla in HER2-positive mouse xenografts. This model is able to capture the impact of the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) on tumor penetration, the net result of drug deconjugation, and the effect of using unconjugated antibody to drive ADC penetration deeper into the tumor tissue. This modeling approach will provide quantitative and mechanistic support to experimental studies trying to parse the impact of multiple mechanisms of action for these complex drugs.},

Toward this goal, three different analytical methods were developed to measure the concentrations of different ADC-related analytes in the media and cell lysate. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to quantify unconjugated drug (i.e., MMAE) concentrations, a forced deconjugation method was developed to quantify total drug concentrations, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method was developed to quantify total antibody (i.e., trastuzumab) concentrations. Cellular disposition studies were conducted in low-HER2-(GFP-MCF7) and high-HER2-expressing (N87) cell lines, following continuous or 2-hour exposure to MMAE and T-vc-MMAE. Similar intracellular accumulation of MMAE was observed between two cell lines following incubation with plain MMAE. However, when incubated with T-vc-MMAE, much higher intracel-lular exposures of unconjugated drug, total drug, and total antibody were observed in N87 cells compared with GFP-MCF7 cells. A novel single-cell disposition model was developed to simultaneously characterize in vitro pharmacokinetics of all three analytes of the ADC in the media and cellular space. The model was able to characterize all the data well and provided robust estimates of MMAE influx rate, MMAE efflux rate, and intracellular degradation rate for T-vc-MMAE. ADC internalization and degradation rates, HER2 expression, and MMAE efflux rate were found to be the key parameters responsible for intracellular exposure to MMAE, on the basis of a global sensitivity analysis. The single-cell pharmacoki-netics model for ADCs presented here is expected to provide a better framework for characterizing bystander effect of ADCs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Many patients who present with early-stage colorectal cancer (International Union Against Cancer TNM stages I and II) are nevertheless at high risk of relapse. We hypothesized that intratumoral immune reaction could influence their prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS The intratumoral immune reaction was investigated in 29 tumors by large-scale real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cytotoxic (CD8) and memory (CD45RO) T cells were quantified by immunohistochemical analyses of tissue microarrays from the center (CT) and the invasive margin (IM) of the 602 tumors from two independent cohorts. The results were correlated with tumor recurrence and patient survival. RESULTS Patients with a strong infiltration of CD45RO(+) cells in the tumor exhibited an increased expression of T-helper 1 and cytotoxicity-related genes. Densities of CD45RO(+) and CD8(+) cells in tumor regions (CT/IM) classified the patients into four distinct prognostic groups based on the presence of high density of each marker in each tumor region. The four groups were associated with dramatic differences in disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival (all P {\textless} .0001). Five years after diagnosis, only 4.8{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.6{\%} to 8.8{\%}) of patients with high densities of CD8(+) plus CD45RO(+) cells had tumor recurrence, and 86.2{\%} (CI, 79.4{\%} to 93.6{\%}) survived. In contrast, the tumor recurred in 75{\%} (95{\%} CI, 17{\%} to 92.5{\%}) of patients with low densities of these cells, and only 27.5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 10.5{\%} to 72{\%}) survived (all P {\textless} .0001). Multivariate analyses showed that the immune criteria had independent effects on the rates of complete remission and survival. CONCLUSION The combined analysis of CD8(+) plus CD45RO(+) cells in specific tumor regions could provide a useful criterion for the prediction of tumor recurrence and survival in patients with early-stage colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Purpose: Optimal dosing is critical for immunocytokine-based cancer immunotherapy to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. Cergutuzumab amunaleukin (CEA-IL2v) is a novel CEA-targeted immunocytokine. We set out to develop a mathematical model to predict intratumoral CEA-IL2v concentrations following various systemic dosing intensities.Experimental Design: Sequential measurements of CEA-IL2v plasma concentrations in 74 patients with solid tumors were applied in a series of differential equations to devise a model that also incorporates the peripheral concentrations of IL2 receptor-positive cell populations (i.e., CD8+, CD4+, NK, and B cells), which affect tumor bioavailability of CEA-IL2v. Imaging data from a subset of 14 patients were subsequently utilized to additionally predict antibody uptake in tumor tissues.Results: We created a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic mathematical model that incorporates the expansion of IL2R-positive target cells at multiple dose levels and different schedules of CEA-IL2v. Model-based prediction of drug levels correlated with the concentration of IL2R-positive cells in the peripheral blood of patients. The pharmacokinetic model was further refined and extended by adding a model of antibody uptake, which is based on drug dose and the biological properties of the tumor. In silico predictions of our model correlated with imaging data and demonstrated that a dose-dense schedule comprising escalating doses and shortened intervals of drug administration can improve intratumoral drug uptake and overcome consumption of CEA-IL2v by the expanding population of IL2R-positive cells.Conclusions: The model presented here allows simulation of individualized treatment plans for optimal dosing and scheduling of immunocytokines for anticancer immunotherapy.

abstract = {PURPOSE The prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer has sometimes proved uncertain; thus, the prognostic significance of immune criteria was compared with that of the tumor extension criteria using the American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer-TNM (AJCC/UICC-TNM) staging system. PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied the intratumoral immune infiltrates in the center of the tumor and in the invasive margin of 599 specimens of stage I to IV colorectal cancers from two independent cohorts. We analyzed these findings in relation to the degree of tumor extension and to the frequency of recurrence. RESULTS Growth of the primary tumor and metastatic spread were associated with decreased intratumoral immune T-cell densities. Sixty percent of patients with high densities of CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltrate presented with stage Tis/T1 tumor, whereas no patients with low densities presented with such early-stage tumor. In patients who did not relapse, the density of CD8 infiltrates was inversely correlated with T stage. In contrast, in patients whose tumor recurred, the number of CD8 cells was low regardless of the T stage of the tumor. Univariate analysis showed that the immune score was significantly associated with differences in disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64, 0.60, and 0.70, respectively; P {\textless} .005). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis illustrated the predictive accuracy of the immune parameters (c-index = 65.3{\%}, time-dependent c-index [C$\tau$] = 66.5{\%}). A final stepwise model for Cox multivariate analysis supports the advantage of the immune score (HR, 0.64; P {\textless} .001; C$\tau$ = 67.9{\%}) compared with histopathologic features in predicting recurrence as well as survival. CONCLUSION Assessment of CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes in combined tumor regions provides an indicator of tumor recurrence beyond that predicted by AJCC/UICC-TNM staging.},

abstract = {Background: Adoptive cellar immunotherapy is not widely approved as a treatment option for cancer treatment. The preliminary results from our phase III, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for lung cancer indicated significant advantages in patients receiving immunotherapy. Here we report the final results and long-term analysis of this RCT. Methods: A hundred and three postsurgical non-small-cell lung cancer patients were randomly designated to receive either chemoimmunotherapy (group A, immunotherapy arm, n=51) or chemotherapy (group B, control arm, n=52). The immunotherapy consisted of adoptive transfer of autologous activated killer T cells and dendritic cells obtained from regional lymph nodes of the patients. Results: The 2- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 96-0{\%} and 69.4{\%} in group A and 64-7{\%} and 45.1{\%} in group B, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.451 (0.235-0.807) by multivariate analysis. The 2- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 70.0{\%} and 57-9{\%} in group A and 43.1{\%} and 31.4{\%} in group B, respectively. P values of Log-rank test between groups were 0.0059. Subgroup analysis for the OS between treatment groups indicated males (HR, 0-474), adenocarcinoma patients (HR, 0-479), stage III cancer patients (HR, 0-399), and those who did not receive preoperative chemotherapy (HR, 0-483) had lower HRs than those in the other groups. Immunological analysis of cell surface markers in regional lymph nodes of subjects receiving immunotherapy indicated that the CD8+/CD4+ T-cell ratio was elevated in survivors. Conclusions: Non-small-cell lung cancer patients benefited from adoptive cellular immunotherapy as an adjuvant to surgery. Immunological analysis of cell surface markers indicated cytotoxic T cells were essential for a favorable chemoimmunotherapy outcome.},

abstract = {Studies on the Adept approach over the last 6 years have indicated its general feasibility. The therapeutic responses observed so far in the clinic are modest but have been obtained with a prodrug that will be surpassed. Substantial progress has been made in understanding and controlling the distribution of the enzyme which is critical to a major advance in the distribution of a cytotoxic drug. In Adept the distinction between a prodrug and its active component provides a further opportunity to improve selectivity by using a second enzyme system which must be retained within the vascular compartment to inactivate any active drug which is generated within or otherwise enters the vascular compartment (IVIAD). A third way in which enzymes can be used to improve the selectivity of cancer chemotherapy relates to those agents whose action can be reversed by a 'rescue agent'. Here the enzyme is delivered to tumor sites, as in Adept, by conjugation to an antibody directed to a tumor associated antigen. The cytotoxic drug is given together with a rescue agent to protect normal tissues but enzyme inactivates the rescue agent at tumor sites (IRATS) thereby leaving the tumour exposed to the unopposed action of the drug. Oncological experience does not encourage us to think that any form of 'one shot' therapy, however efficient, will have a major impact on the course of common cancers. Non-immunogenic antibodies and conjugates are already being developed but where immunogenic agents are used, control of the host response will be necessary to allow adequate treatment to be given. Present experience with cyclosporin suggests that this is attainable. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Cergutuzumab amunaleukin (CEA-IL2v) is an immunocytokine directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) containing an IL2v-moiety with abolished IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) a binding. We describe the biodistribution and tumor accumulation of 89 Zr-labeled CEA-IL2v. Twenty-four patients with advanced solid CEA positive (CEA+) or negative (CEA-) tumors received CEA-IL2v 6 mg (4 CEA+; 3 CEA-), 20 mg (9 CEA+), or 30 mg (4 CEA+; 4 CEA-) biweekly. In cycle 1, 2 mg of the total dose comprised 89 Zr-CEA-IL2v (50 MBq) and serial 89 Zr-PET imaging was conducted. Four CEA+ patients with visually confirmed 89 Zr-CEA-IL2v tumor accumulation at 20 mg had repeated 89 Zr-PET imaging during cycle 4. 89 Zr-CEA-IL2v immuno-PET demonstrated preferential drug accumulation in CEA+ tumors ({\%}ID/mL peak CEA- 3.6 × 10 -3 vs. CEA+ 6.7 ×{\textperiodcentered}10 -3 ). There was a non-significant trend towards dose-dependent tumor uptake, with higher uptake at doses ≥20 mg. Biodistribution was dose- and CEA-independent with major accumulation in lymphoid tissue compatible with IL-2R binding. Reduced exposure and reduced tumor accumulation ({\%}ID/mL peak 57{\%} lower) on cycle 4 vs. cycle 1 was consistent with peripheral expansion of immune cells. The findings of this immune PET imaging study with 89 Zr-CEA-IL2v support the therapeutic concept of CEA-IL2v, confirming selective and targeted tumor accumulation with this novel immunocytokine.},

This success is based on progress in both preclinical and clinical science, including the development of new methods of investigation. Immuno-oncology has become a sub-specialty within oncology owing to its unique science and its potential for substantial and long-term clinical benefit. Immunotherapy agents do not directly attack the tumour but instead mobilize the immune system - this can be achieved through various approaches that utilize adaptive or innate immunity. Therefore, immuno-oncology drug development encompasses a broad range of agents, including antibodies, peptides, proteins, small molecules, adjuvants, cytokines, oncolytic viruses, bi-specific molecules and cellular therapies. This Perspective summarizes the recent history of cancer immunotherapy, including the factors that led to its success, provides an overview of novel drug-development considerations, summarizes three generations of immunotherapies that have been developed since 2011 and, thus, illustrates the breadth of opportunities these new generations of immunotherapies represent.},

abstract = {Abstract Poor drug delivery and penetration of antibody-mediated therapies pose significant obstacles to effective treatment of solid tumors. This study explored the role of pharmacokinetics, valency, and molecular weight in maximizing drug delivery. Biodistribution of a fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) targeting CovX-body (an FGFR4-binding peptide covalently linked to a nontargeting IgG scaffold; 150 kDa) and enzymatically generated {\{}FGFR4{\}} targeting F(ab)2 (100 kDa) and Fab (50 kDa) fragments was measured. Peak tumor levels were achieved in 1 to 2 hours for Fab and F(ab)2versus 8 hours for IgG, and the percentage injected dose in tumors was 0.45{\%}, 0.5{\%}, and 2.5{\%}, respectively, compared to 0.3{\%}, 2{\%}, and 6{\%} of their nontargeting controls. To explore the contribution of multivalent binding, homodimeric peptides were conjugated to the different sized scaffolds, creating {\{}FGFR4{\}} targeting IgG and F(ab)2 with four peptides and Fab with two peptides. Increased valency resulted in an increase in cell surface binding of the bivalent constructs. There was an inverse relationship between valency and intratumoral drug concentration, consistent with targeted consumption. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased size and increased cell binding decreased tumor penetration. The binding site barrier hypothesis suggests that limited tumor penetration, as a result of high-affinity binding, could result in decreased efficacy. In our studies, increased target binding translated into superior efficacy of the IgG instead, because of superior inhibition of {\{}FGFR4{\}} proliferation pathways and dosing through the binding site barrier. Increasing valency is therefore an effective way to increase the efficacy of antibody-based drugs.},

abstract = {The use of antibody-based therapeutics has proven very promising for clinical applications in cancer patients, with multiple examples of antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates successfully applied for the treatment of solid tumors and lymphomas. Given reported recurrence rates, improvements are clearly still necessary. A major factor limiting the efficacy of antibody-targeted cancer therapies may be the incomplete penetration of the antibody or antibody-drug conjugate into the tumor. Incomplete tumor penetration also affects the outcome of molecular imaging, when using such targeting agents. From the injection site until they arrive inside the tumor, targeting molecules are faced with several barriers that impact intratumoral distribution. The primary means of antibody transport inside tumors is based on diffusion. The diffusive penetration inside the tumor is influenced by both antibody properties, such as size and binding affinity, as well as tumor properties, such as microenvironment, vascularization, and targeted antigen availability. Engineering smaller antibody fragments has shown to improve the rate of tumor uptake and intratumoral distribution. However, it is often accompanied by more rapid clearance from the body and in several cases also by inherent destabilization and reduction of the binding affinity of the antibody. In this perspective, we discuss different cancer targeting approaches based on antibodies or their fragments. We carefully consider how their size and binding properties influence their intratumoral uptake and distribution, and how this may affect cancer imaging and therapy of solid tumors.},

abstract = {The ability to use a systemically injected agent to image tumor is influenced by tumor characteristics such as permeability and vascularity, and the size, shape, and affinity of the imaging agent. In this study, six different imaging biomolecules, with or without specificity to tumor, were examined for tumor uptake and internalization at the whole body, ex-vivo tissue, and cellular levels: antibodies, antibody fragments (Fab), serum albumin, and streptavidin. The time of peak tumor uptake was dependent solely on the size of molecules, suggesting that molecular size is the major factor that influences tumor uptake by its effect on systemic clearance and diffusion into tumor. Affinity to tumor antigen failed to augment tumor uptake of Fab above non-specific accumulation, which suggests that Fab fragments of typical monoclonal antibodies may fall below an affinity threshold for use as molecular imaging agents. Despite abundant localization into the tumor, albumin and streptavidin were not found on cell surface or inside cells. By comparing biomolecules differing in size and affinity, our study highlights that while pharmacokinetics are a dominant factor in tumor uptake for biomolecules, affinity to tumor antigen is required for tumor binding and internalization.},

abstract = {We developed cergutuzumab amunaleukin (CEA-IL2v, RG7813), a novel monomeric CEA-targeted immunocytokine, that comprises a single IL-2 variant (IL2v) moiety with abolished CD25 binding, fused to the C-terminus of a high affinity, bivalent carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-specific antibody devoid of Fc-mediated effector functions. Its molecular design aims to (i) avoid preferential activation of regulatory T-cells vs. immune effector cells by removing CD25 binding; (ii) increase the therapeutic index of IL-2 therapy by (a) preferential retention at the tumor by having a lower dissociation rate from CEA-expressing cancer cells vs. IL-2R-expressing cells, (b) avoiding any Fc$\gamma$R-binding and Fc effector functions and (c) reduced binding to endothelial cells expressing CD25; and (iii) improve the pharmacokinetics, and thus convenience of administration, of IL-2. The crystal structure of the IL2v-IL-2R$\beta$$\gamma$ complex was determined and CEA-IL2v activity was assessed using human immune effector cells. Tumor targeting was investigated in tumor-bearing mice using 89Zr-labeled CEA-IL2v. Efficacy studies were performed in (a) syngeneic mouse models as monotherapy and combined with anti-PD-L1, and in (b) xenograft mouse models in combination with ADCC-mediating antibodies. CEA-IL2v binds to CEA with pM avidity but not to CD25, and consequently did not preferentially activate Tregs. In vivo, CEA-IL2v demonstrated superior pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting compared with a wild-type IL-2-based CEA immunocytokine (CEA-IL2wt). CEA-IL2v strongly expanded NK and CD8+ T cells, skewing the CD8+:CD4+ ratio toward CD8+ T cells both in the periphery and in the tumor, and mediated single agent efficacy in syngeneic MC38-CEA and PancO2-CEA models. Combination with trastuzumab, cetuximab and imgatuzumab, all of human IgG1 isotype, resulted in superior efficacy compared with the monotherapies alone. Combined with anti-PD-L1, CEA-IL2v mediated superior efficacy over the respective monotherapies, and over the combination with an untargeted control immunocytokine. These preclinical data support the ongoing clinical investigation of the cergutuzumab amunaleukin immunocytokine with abolished CD25 binding for the treatment of CEA-positive solid tumors in combination with PD-L1 checkpoint blockade and ADCC competent antibodies.},

abstract = {A diverse array of tumor targeting agents ranging in size from peptides to nanoparticles is currently under development for applications in cancer imaging and therapy. However, it remains largely unclear how size differences among these molecules influence their targeting properties. Here, we develop a simple, mechanistic model that can be used to understand and predict the complex interplay between molecular size, affinity, and tumor uptake. Empirical relationships between molecular radius and capillary permeability, interstitial diffusivity, available volume fraction, and plasma clearance were obtained using data in the literature. These relationships were incorporated into a compartmental model of tumor targeting using MATLAB to predict the magnitude, specificity, time dependence, and affinity dependence of tumor uptake for molecules across a broad size spectrum. In the typical size range for proteins, the model uncovers a complex trend in which intermediate-sized targeting agents (MW, approximately 25 kDa) have the lowest tumor uptake, whereas higher tumor uptake levels are achieved by smaller and larger agents. Small peptides accumulate rapidly in the tumor but require high affinity to be retained, whereas larger proteins can achieve similar retention with {\textgreater}100-fold weaker binding. For molecules in the size range of liposomes, the model predicts that antigen targeting will not significantly increase tumor uptake relative to untargeted molecules. All model predictions are shown to be consistent with experimental observations from published targeting studies. The results and techniques have implications for drug development, imaging, and therapeutic dosing.},

For diagnostics, protease activity may be mea- sured as a biomarker of cancer, with wide-ranging utility from early detection to monitoring therapeutic response.

Strategies that coopt protease activity as molecular triggers are increasingly important in nanoparticle design, yet the pharmacokinetics of these systems are challenging to understand without a quantitative framework to reveal nonintuitive associations. We describe a multicompartment mathematical model to predict strategies for ultrasensitive detection of cancer using synthetic biomarkers, a class of activity-based probes that amplify cancer-derived signals into urine as a noninvasive diagnostic. Using a model formulation made of a PEG core conjugated with protease-cleavable peptides, we explore a vast design space and identify guidelines for increasing sensitivity that depend on critical parameters such as enzyme kinetics, dosage, and probe stability. According to this model, synthetic biomarkers that circulate in stealth but then activate at sites of disease have the theoretical capacity to discriminate tumors as small as 5 mm in diameter—a threshold sensitivity that is otherwise challenging for medical imaging and blood biomarkers to achieve. This model may be adapted to describe the behavior of additional activity-based approaches to allow cross-platform comparisons, and to predict allometric scaling across species.},

Unfortunately, most attempts to exploit the T-cell immune system against nonviral malignancies in the syngeneic setting have been disappointing. In contrast, treatments based on monoclonal antibodies (Abs) have been clinically successful and have demonstrated the clinical relevance of several antigens as therapeutic targets and the importance of the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) pathway. In the present study, we considered the possibility of arming specific T cells with a receptor that would enable them to mediate ADCC. After transduction with a CD16/gamma receptor gene, CD4(+) and CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes displayed stable expression of the CD16 receptor at their surface. In the absence of Ab, CD16/gamma expression did not affect the capacity of specific T lymphocytes to kill their target following "natural" T-cell receptor recognition. When tested against the autologous B-lymphoblastoid cell line (BLCL) coated with anti-CD20 mAb, the newly expressed Fc receptor enabled the T cells to kill the BLCL through ADCC. Adoptive transfer of such newly designed immune effector may be considered to increase antibody efficiency by harnessing the immune potential of T cells.},

Using target cell transfectants sorted to stably express different levels of the MHC class I protein HLA-Cw6, we show that induction of degranulation and that of IFN-$\gamma$ secretion are not correlated. In contrast, the inhibition of these two processes by MHC class-I occurs at the same level of class I MHC protein. Primary human NK cell clones were found to differ in the amount of target MHC class I protein required for their inhibition, rather than in their maximum killing capacity. Importantly, we show that KIR2DL1 expression determines the thresholds (in terms of MHC I protein levels) required for NK cell inhibition, while the expression of other receptors such as LIR1 is less important. Furthermore, using mathematical models to explore the dynamics of target cell killing, we found that the observed delay in target cell killing is exhibited by a model in which NK cells require some activation or priming, such that each cell can lyse a target cell only after being activated by a first encounter with the same or a different target cell, but not by models which lack this feature.},

abstract = {T lymphocytes (T cells) express T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules on their surface that can recognize peptides (p) derived from antigenic proteins bound to products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The pMHC molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). T cells first encounter antigen on DCs in lymph nodes (LN). Intravital microscopy experiments show that upon entering the LN containing antigen, CD8+ T cells first move rapidly. After a few hours, they stop and make extended contacts with DCs. The factors that determine when and how this transition occurs are not well understood. We report results from computer simulations that suggest that the duration of phase one is related to the low probability of productive interactions between T cells and DCs. This is demonstrated by our finding that the antigen dose and type determine when such a transition occurs. These results are in agreement with experimental observations. TCR-pMHC binding characteristics and the antigen dose determine the time required for a productive T-cell-DC encounter (resulting in sustained contact). We find that the ratio of this time scale and the half-life of the pMHC complex itself provide a consolidated measure of antigen quantity and type. Results obtained upon varying different measures of antigen quantity and type fall on one curve when graphed against this ratio of time scales. Thus, we provide a mechanism for how the effects of varying one set of parameters are influenced by other prevailing conditions. This understanding should help guide future experimentation.},

abstract = {Immunotherapies exploit the immune system to target and kill cancer cells, while sparing healthy tissue. Antibody therapies, an important class of immunotherapies, involve the binding to specific antigens on the surface of the tumour cells of antibodies that activate natural killer (NK) cells to kill the tumour cells. Preclinical assessment of molecules that may cause antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) involves co-culturing cancer cells, NK cells and antibody in vitro for several hours and measuring subsequent levels of tumour cell lysis. Here we develop a mathematical model of such an in vitro ADCC assay, formulated as a system of time-dependent ordinary differential equations and in which NK cells kill cancer cells at a rate which depends on the amount of antibody bound to each cancer cell. Numerical simulations generated using experimentally-based parameter estimates reveal that the system evolves on two timescales: a fast timescale on which antibodies bind to receptors on the surface of the tumour cells, and NK cells form complexes with the cancer cells, and a longer time-scale on which the NK cells kill the cancer cells. We construct approximate model solutions on each timescale, and show that they are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results show how the processes involved in ADCC change as the initial concentration of antibody and NK-cancer cell ratio are varied. We use these results to explain what information about the tumour cell kill rate can be extracted from the cytotoxicity assays.},

Using a model of systemic self-antigen recognition by CD4(+) T cells, we show, using single-cell biochemical analyses, that tolerance is characterized by transient signaling events downstream of T-cell receptor engagement in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and NF-kappaB pathways. Parallel studies done by live cell imaging show that the key difference between tolerance and activation is the duration of the T cell-antigen presenting cell (APC) interaction, as revealed by stable T-cell immobilization on antigen encounter. Brief T cell-APC interactions result in tolerance, and prolonged interactions are associated with activation and the development of effector cells.

abstract = {Recent experimental results show that even brief stimulation with antigen can cause antigen-specific CD8 T-cells to undergo sustained proliferation followed by differentiation into memory cells. These results show that the dynamics of these immune responses are not governed by constant monitoring of antigen levels, but rather that following stimulation immune cells commit to a "program". At present relatively little is known about the program which governs CD8 cell proliferation and differentiation. For example, we do not know whether the program is completely specified by the initial encounter of a T cell with antigen, or whether it subsequently can be modified by the amount of antigen present. Nor do we know whether the entire program for T cell proliferation and differentiation resides within the T cell itself, or whether some component(s) of the program are determined by cells or molecules external to the CD8 cell. In this paper we construct simple mathematical models which incorporate antigen-independent proliferation and differentiation of CD8 cells during acute infections. We use these models to determine what characteristics the program must have in order to be consistent with the existing data on the dynamics of CD8 responses, and in particular to answer the questions posed above. Our results suggest that the program is not completely defined by the initial encounter of T cell with antigen but may be augmented by exposure to antigen in a brief window shortly after infection; furthermore, parts of the program may reside external to the T-cells. Finally we examine some of the consequences of the "program" for pathogen-host coevolution. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {A majority of human therapeutic antibody candidates show pharmacokinetic properties suitable for clinical use, but an unexpectedly fast antibody clearance is sometimes observed that may limit the clinical utility. Pharmacokinetic data in cynomolgus monkeys collected for a panel of 52 antibodies showed broad distribution of target-independent clearance values (2.4-61.3 mL/day/kg), with 15 (29{\%}) having clearance {\textgreater} 10 mL/day/kg. Alteration in the interaction with the recycling FcRn receptor did not account for the faster than expected clearance observed for the antibodies; off-target binding was presumed to account for the fast clearance. We developed an assay based on ELISA detection of non-specific binding to baculovirus particles that can identify antibodies having increased risk for fast clearance. This assay can be used during lead generation or optimization to identify antibodies with increased risk of having fast clearance in both humans and cynomolgus monkeys, and thus increase the likelihood of obtaining a suitable drug candidate.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy in clinical trials, safety and tolerability, and place in therapy of blinatumomab are reviewed. SUMMARY Blinatumomab is a novel, bispecific, T-cell engaging antibody that targets tumor-associated antigens CD19 and CD3. Blinatumomab was approved through an accelerated pathway for the treatment of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One Phase II trial found 16 of 21 patients to be negative for minimal residual disease (MRD) after one cycle of treatment, resulting in a response rate of 80{\%}. Another Phase II trial showed an 82{\%} MRD response, even in heavily pretreated patients. The most common adverse events of any grade noted were pyrexia, febrile neutropenia, hypokalemia, and anemia. The most frequently occurring grade 3 or 4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Cycle 1 is dosed as a 9- $\mu$g/ day continuous i.v. infusion on days 1-7 and a 28-$\mu$g/day continuous i.v. infusion on days 8-28 administered as a four-week continuous i.v. infusion, followed by at least two weeks of no treatment. Subsequent cycles are dosed as a 28-$\mu$g/day continuous i.v. infusion on days 1-28, followed by at least two weeks of no treatment, for up to five treatment cycles. CONCLUSION Blinatumomab is approved as an option for Ph chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL and is a needed addition to the limited treatment options for this difficult-to-treat patient population. Two Phase II clinical trials resulted in impressive results when using blinatumomab as a single agent, resulting in the drug's approval.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the disease status of degenerative diseases (i.e., type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease) as function of disease process and treatment effects, a family of disease progression models is introduced. METHODS: Disease progression is described using a progression rate (Rdp) acting on the synthesis or elimination parameters of the indirect response model. Symptomatic effects act as disease-dependent or -independent effects on the synthesis or elimination parameters. Protective drug effects act as disease dependent or -independent effects on Rdp. RESULTS: Simulations with the ten disease models show distinctly different signature profiles of treatment effects on disease status. Symptomatic effects result in improvement of disease status with a subsequent deterioration. Treatment cessation results in a disease status equal to the situation where treatment had not been applied. Protective effects result in a lasting reduction, or even reversal, of the disease progression rate and the resulting disease status during the treatment period. After cessation of treatment the natural disease course will continue from the disease status at that point. CONCLUSION: Disease system analysis constitutes a scientific basis for the distinction between symptomatic versus protective drug effects in relation to specific disease processes as well as the identification of the exposure-response relationship during the time-course of disease.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the therapy of cancer patients. Although antibody therapy has continuously been improved, still a significant number of patients do not benefit from antibody therapy. Therefore, rational optimization of the antibody molecule by Fc engineering represents a major area of translational research to further improve this potent therapeutic option. Monoclonal antibodies are able to trigger a variety of effector mechanisms. Especially Fc-mediated effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement- dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) are considered important in antibody therapy of cancer. Novel mechanistic insights into the action of monoclonal antibodies allowed the development of various Fc engineering approaches to modulate antibodies' effector functions. Strategies in modifying the Fc glycosylation profile (Fc glyco-engineering) or approaches in engineering the protein backbone (Fc protein engineering) have been intensively evaluated. In the current review, Fc engineering strategies resulting in improved ADCC, ADCP and CDC activity are summarized and discussed.},

abstract = {Systemic injection of therapeutic antibodies may cause serious adverse effects due to on-target toxicity to the antigens expressed in normal tissues. To improve the targeting selectivity to the region of disease sites, we developed protease-activated pro-antibodies by masking the binding sites of antibodies with inhibitory domains that can be removed by proteases that are highly expressed at the disease sites. The latency-associated peptide (LAP), C2b or CBa of complement factor 2/B were linked, through a substrate peptide of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), to an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody and an anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibody. Results showed that all the inhibitory domains could be removed by MMP-2 to restore the binding activities of the antibodies. LAP substantially reduced (53.8{\%}) the binding activity of the anti-EGFR antibody on EGFR-expressing cells, whereas C2b and CBa were ineffective (21{\%} and 9.3{\%} reduction, respectively). Similarly, LAP also blocked 53.9{\%} of the binding activity of the anti-TNF-alpha antibody. Finally, molecular dynamic simulation showed that the masking efficiency of LAP, C2b and CBa was 33.7{\%}, 10.3{\%} and -5.4{\%}, respectively, over the binding sites of the antibodies. This strategy may aid in designing new protease-activated pro-antibodies that attain high therapeutic potency yet reduced systemic on-target toxicity.},

abstract = {Antibody-based cancer treatment depends upon distribution of the targeting macromolecule throughout tumor tissue, and spatial heterogeneity could significantly limit efficacy in many cases. Antibody distribution in tumor tissue is a function of drug dosage, antigen concentration, binding affinity, antigen internalization, drug extravasation from blood vessels, diffusion in the tumor extracellular matrix, and systemic clearance rates. We have isolated the effects of a subset of these variables by live-cell microscopic imaging of single-chain antibody fragments against carcinoembryonic antigen in LS174T tumor spheroids. The measured rates of scFv penetration and retention were compared with theoretical predictions based on simple scaling criteria. The theory predicts that antibody dose must be large enough to drive a sufficient diffusive flux of antibody to overcome cellular internalization, and exposure time must be long enough to allow penetration to the spheroid center. The experimental results in spheroids are quantitatively consistent with these predictions. Therefore, simple scaling criteria can be applied to accurately predict antibody and antibody fragment penetration distance in tumor tissue.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer cell-initiated cell death is one of the primary mechanisms used by higher organisms to eliminate viruses and transformed cells. In this context, target cell death is rapid and efficient and initiated via two main pathways, involving either the ligation of death receptors or through the granule-exocytosis pathway. The granule-exocytosis pathway has attracted much attention over the past 10 years and consequently, a mechanism for granule-dependent killing has become reasonably well established. In the granule-dependent pathway, several proteolytic enzymes called granzymes are delivered to the target cell, promoting the activation of a family of death-inducing proteases called caspases.

abstract = {Although inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway was expected to eliminate a key resistance mechanism for EGF receptor (EGFR)-driven cancers, the effectiveness of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) inhibitors in clinical trials has been limited. A multiplicity of survival mechanisms are available to cancer cells. Both IGF-IR and the ErbB3 receptor activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, but ErbB3 has only recently been pursued as a therapeutic target. We show that coactivation of the ErbB3 pathway is prevalent in a majority of cell lines responsive to IGF ligands and antagonizes IGF-IR-mediated growth inhibition. Blockade of the redundant IGF-IR and ErbB3 survival pathways and downstream resistance mechanisms was achieved with MM-141, a tetravalent bispecific antibody antagonist of IGF-IR and ErbB3. MM-141 potency was superior to monospecific and combination antibody therapies and was insensitive to variation in the ratio of IGF-IR and ErbB3 receptors. MM-141 enhanced the biologic impact of receptor inhibition in vivo as a monotherapy and in combination with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, gemcitabine, or docetaxel, through blockade of IGF-IR and ErbB3 signaling and prevention of PI3K/AKT/mTOR network adaptation.},

In this review, we examine the design and therapeutic potential of immunocytokines and bispecific antibodies, two classes of bifunctional products which can selectively activate the immune system at the tumor site. Certain protein engineering aspects, such as the choice of the antibody format, are common to both classes of therapeutic agents and can have a profound impact on tumor homing performance in vivo of individual products. However, immunocytokines and bispecific antibodies display different mechanisms of action.

abstract = {Recent clinical data demonstrate the significance of T cells in anti-tumor activity. For instance, the CD19/CD3 bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) blinatumomab is a proven means of harnessing T cells for cancer treatment. BiTE antibody constructs comprise an anti-CD3 scFv (single chain variable fragment) linked to an scFv binding a tumor-associated antigen (TAA). One potential challenge for TAA-targeted therapeutics is that treatment may only eliminate TAA-expressing tumor cells and heterogeneity of TAA expression becomes a potential means of resistance. To prevent escape of TAA-negative tumor cells, a treatment modality with a bystander effect on TAA-negative cells may be desirable. To evaluate the potential of BiTE antibodies to mediate bystander cell killing, mixtures of TAA-positive and -negative (bystander) cells were co-cultured with human T cells and the effect of BiTE antibodies tested. Lysis of TAA-expressing and bystander cells was evaluated using both imaging and viability assays. For this study, we used BiTE antibodies recognizing either epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or CD33. In the presence of TAA-positive cells, T cells were activated and bystander cells lysed. In the absence of TAA-positive cells, bystander cells were not killed. Bystander cell lysis was also observed in a xenograft mouse model with subcutaneous tumors comprising EGFR-positive and -negative cancer cells, and human T-cells. The mechanism of BiTE-mediated bystander killing was further investigated. In the presence of TAA-positive cells, T cells released many cytokines, including IFN-$\gamma$ and TNF$\alpha$. However, exposure of bystander cells to just the soluble factors released by T cells did not induce their lysis, suggesting that a direct interaction between BiTE-activated T cells and bystander cells was required. BiTE treatment induced the expression on bystander cells of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), a protein involved in formation of cytolytic T cell synapses with target cells. ICAM-1 upregulation on bystander cells was also observed following exposure to recombinant IFN-$\gamma$ and TNF$\alpha$. These findings suggest that exposure of bystander cells to cytokines secreted by BiTE-activated T cells caused ICAM-1 expression on bystander cells leading to their improved attachment and cytolytic synapse formation. Blockade of ICAM-1 by an antibody partially protected bystander cells from lysis. Our data suggest a model where BiTE-activated T cells secrete cytokines that cause upregulation of ICAM-1 on TAA-negative cells. This can then lead to T cell binding and T cell-induced bystander cell lysis. This mechanism is not expected to cause systemic cell death because only those cells proximal to the activated T cell in the tumor environment would be exposed to sufficiently high concentrations of ICAM-1-inducing cytokines. However, this locally confined bystander cell lysis may be sufficient to enable effective treatment of tumors that are heterogeneous for TAA expression.},

abstract = {TAM-163, an agonist monoclonal antibody targeting tyrosine receptor kinase-B (TrkB), is currently being investigated as a potential body weight modulatory agent in humans. To support the selection of the dose range for the first-in-human (FIH) trial of TAM-163, we conducted a mechanistic analysis of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data (e.g., body weight gain) obtained in lean cynomolgus and obese rhesus monkeys following single doses ranging from 0.3 to 60 mg/kg. A target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model was used to describe the observed nonlinear PK and Emax approach was used to describe the observed dose-dependent PD effect. The TMDD model development was supported by the experimental determination of the binding affinity constant (9.4 nM) and internalization rate of the drug-target complex (2.08 h(-1)). These mechanistic analyses enabled linking of exposure, target (TrkB) coverage, and pharmacological activity (e.g., PD) in monkeys, and indicated that ≥ 38{\%} target coverage (time-average) was required to achieve significant body weight gain in monkeys. Based on the scaling of the TMDD model from monkeys to humans and assuming similar relationship between the target coverage and pharmacological activity between monkey and humans, subcutaneous (SC) doses of 1 and 15 mg/kg in humans were projected to be the minimally and the fully pharmacologically active doses, respectively. Based on the minimal anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) approach for starting dose selection, the dose of 0.05 mg/kg (3 mg for a 60 kg human) SC was recommended as the starting dose for FIH trials, because at this dose level{\textless}10{\%} target coverage was projected at Cmax (and all other time points). This study illustrates a rational mechanistic approach for the selection of FIH dose range for a therapeutic protein with a complex model of action.},

Compared with traditional small molecule drugs, therapeutic proteins possess many distinct PK/PD features that necessitate the application of modified or separate approaches for assessing their PK/PD relationships. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss tools that are utilized to describe and predict the PK/PD features of therapeutic proteins and that are valuable additions in the armamentarium of drug development approaches to facilitate and accelerate their successful preclinical and clinical development. Expert opinion: A variety of state-of-the-art PK/PD tools is currently being applied and has been adjusted to support the development of proteins as therapeutics, including allometric scaling approaches, target-mediated disposition models, first-in-man dose calculations, physiologically based PK models and empirical and semi-mechanistic PK/PD modeling. With the advent of the next generation of biologics including bioengineered antibody constructs being developed, these tools will need to be further refined and adapted to ensure their applicability and successful facilitation of the drug development process for these novel scaffolds.},

A minimal anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) approach was applied to project the first-in-human (FIH) dose, because of its immune agonistic properties following target engagement. The pharmacological activity of P-cadherin LP-DART is driven by binding to both P-cadherin on the tumor cells and CD3 on T cells. Therefore, the concentration of the tri-molecular synapse formed between drug, T cell, and tumor cell, rather than drug concentration, is responsible for efficacy. A mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)-driven approach was explored to understand the exposure-response relationship based on the synapse concentration to project the MABEL dose. Orthogonal approaches including PK-driven and receptor occupancy calculations were also investigated. This study showcases the application of PK/PD modeling in immune-oncology, and could potentially be implemented for other bispecific biotherapeutics.},

Herein, we primarily focus on the recently discovered complex roles of IL-2 in broadly modulating T cells for T helper cell differentiation. IL-2 does not specify the type of Th differentiation that occurs; instead, IL-2 modulates expression of receptors for other cytokines and transcription factors, thereby either promoting or inhibiting cytokine cascades that correlate with each Th differentiation state. In this fashion, IL-2 can prime and potentially maintain Th1 and Th2 differentiation as well as expand such populations of cells, whereas it inhibits Th17 differentiation but also can expand Th17 cells. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, limited examples exist in literature illustrating this procedure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: An interpretation of the recommended dose-selection methodology and the minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) principle, contained in the updated European Medicines Agency guidance on risk-mitigation strategies for first-in-human studies, is presented. Some literature and simulation-based examples of the application of PK-PD modelling principles to starting dose selection using in vitro and in vivo data under the MABEL paradigm are highlighted, along with the advantages and limitations of this approach.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIMS: To illustrate the use of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models to select rational starting doses in clinical trials within the minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) principle using literature data and through simulations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The new European Medicines Agency guidance on starting dose selection of high-risk biologics was analysed considering the basic pharmacological properties and preclinical testing limitations of many biologics. The MABEL approach to dose selection was illustrated through simulations and through literature-reported examples on the selection of starting doses for biologics such as antibodies based on in vitro biomarker data, in vivo PK and PK-PD data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Literature reports indicating the use of preclinical pharmacological and toxicological data to select successfully safe starting doses in line with the MABEL principle are summarized. PK-PD model-based simulations of receptor occupancy for an anti-IgE antibody system indicate that the relative abundance of IgE in animal models and patients and the turnover rate of the IgE-antibody complex relative to the off-rate of the antibody from IgE are important determinants of in vivo receptor occupancy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Mechanistic PK-PD models are capable of integrating preclinical in vitro and in vivo data to select starting doses rationally in first-in-human trials. Biological drug-receptor interaction dynamics is complex and multiple factors affect the dose-receptor occupancy relationship. Thus, these factors should be taken into account when selecting starting doses.},

Factors associated with the choice of each MRSD determination method were also identified. PubMed was searched for FIH studies with mAbs published in English between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2013, and the following information was extracted: MRSD determination method, publication year, therapeutic area, antibody type, safety factor, safety assessment results after the first dose, and number of dose escalation steps. Seventy-nine FIH studies with mAbs were identified, 49 of which clearly reported the MRSD determination method. The no observed adverse effects level (NOAEL)-based approach was the most frequently used method, whereas the model-based approach was the least commonly used method (34.7{\%} vs 16.3{\%}). The minimal anticipated biological effect level (MABEL)- or minimum effective dose (MED)-based approach was used more frequently in 2011-2013 than in 1990-2007 (31.6{\%} vs 6.3{\%}, P=0.036), reflecting a slow, but steady acceptance of the European Medicines Agency's guidance on mitigating risks for FIH clinical trials (2007). The median safety factor was much lower for the MABEL- or MED-based approach than for the other MRSD determination methods (10 vs 32.2-53). The number of dose escalation steps was not significantly different among the different MRSD determination methods. The MABEL-based approach appears to be safer and as efficient as the other MRSD determination methods for achieving the objectives of FIH studies with mAbs faster.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Optimal dosing is critical for immunocytokine-based cancer immunotherapy to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. Cergutuzumab amunaleukin (CEA-IL2v) is a novel CEA-targeted immunocytokine. We set out to develop a mathematical model to predict intratumoral CEA-IL2v concentrations following various systemic dosing intensities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Sequential measurements of CEA-IL2v plasma concentrations in 74 patients with solid tumors were applied in a series of differential equations to devise a model that also incorporates the peripheral concentrations of IL-2 receptor-positive cell populations (i.e. CD8+, CD4+, NK and B cells) which affect tumor bioavailability of CEA-IL2v. Imaging data from a subset of 14 patients were subsequently utilized to additionally predict antibody uptake in tumor tissues. RESULTS We created a PKPD mathematical model that incorporates the expansion of IL-2R-positive target cells at multiple doses levels and different schedules of CEA-IL2v. Model-based prediction of drug levels correlated with the concentration of IL-2R-positive cells in the peripheral blood of patients. The pharmacokinetic model was further refined and extended by adding a model of antibody uptake, which is based on drug dose and the biological properties of the tumor. In silico predictions of our model correlated with imaging data and demonstrated that a dose-dense schedule comprising escalating doses and shortened intervals of drug administration can improve intratumoral drug uptake and overcome consumption of CEA-IL2v by the expanding population of IL-2R-positive cells. CONCLUSIONS The model presented here allows simulation of individualized treatment plans for optimal dosing and scheduling of immunocytokines for anti-cancer immunotherapy.},

abstract = {We retrospectively examined the nonclinical studies conducted with 17 CD3 bispecific constructs in support of first-in-human (FIH) trials in oncology. We also collected information on the design of dose-finding clinical trials. Sponsors have used different MABEL approaches for FIH dose selection. To better assess acceptable approaches, FIH doses were computed from nonclinical studies and compared to the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) in patients, to the highest human doses (HHDs) when an MTD was not identified, or to the recommended human dose (RHD) for blinatumomab. We concluded that approaches based on receptor occupancy, highest non-severely toxic dose, or no-observed adverse effect level are not acceptable for selecting the FIH dose as they resulted in doses close to or above the MTDs, HHDs, or the RHD. A FIH dose corresponding to 10{\%}–30{\%} pharmacologic activity (PA) was an acceptable approach. A FIH dose corresponding to 50{\%} PA was acceptable for all except one construct, potentially due to its biological or structural properties. The most common toxicities in animals and patients were those related to cytokine release. Doses were better tolerated when intra-animal or intra-patient dose escalation was used. Exposing na{\"{i}}ve patients to an MTD achieved with intra-patient dose escalation design may be unsafe.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Aldesleukin, recombinant human IL2, is an effective immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma and renal cancer, with durable responses in approximately 10{\%} of patients; however, severe side effects limit maximal dosing and thus the number of patients able to receive treatment and potential cure. NKTR-214 is a prodrug of conjugated IL2, retaining the same amino acid sequence as aldesleukin. The IL2 core is conjugated to 6 releasable polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. In vivo, the PEG chains slowly release to generate active IL2 conjugates. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We evaluated the bioactivity and receptor binding of NKTR-214 and its active IL2 conjugates in vitro; the tumor immunology, tumor pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of NKTR-214 as a single agent and in combination with anti-CTLA-4 antibody in murine tumor models. Tolerability was evaluated in non-human primates. RESULTS In a murine melanoma tumor model, the ratio of tumor-killing CD8(+) T cells to Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells was greater than 400 for NKTR-214 compared with 18 for aldesleukin, supporting preferential activation of the IL2 receptor beta over IL2 receptor alpha, due to the location of PEG molecules. NKTR-214 provides a 500-fold greater exposure of the tumor to conjugated IL2 compared with aldesleukin. NKTR-214 showed efficacy as a single agent and provided durable immunity that was resistant to tumor rechallenge in combination with anti-CTLA-4 antibody. NKTR-214 was well tolerated in non-human primates. CONCLUSIONS These data support further evaluation of NKTR-214 in humans for a variety of tumor types, adding to the repertoire of potent and potentially curative cancer immunotherapies.

abstract = {Cytokines are potent immune modulating agents but are not ideal medicines in their natural form due to their short half-life and pleiotropic systemic effects. NKTR-214 is a clinical-stage biologic that comprises interleukin-2 (IL2) protein bound by multiple releasable polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. In this highly PEG-bound form, the IL2 is inactive; therefore, NKTR-214 is a biologic prodrug. When administered in vivo, the PEG chains slowly release, creating a cascade of increasingly active IL2 protein conjugates bound by fewer PEG chains. The 1-PEG-IL2 and 2-PEG-IL2 species derived from NKTR-214 are the most active conjugated-IL2 species. Free-IL2 protein is undetectable in vivo as it is eliminated faster than formed. The PEG chains on NKTR-214 are located at the region of IL2 that contacts the alpha ($\alpha$) subunit of the heterotrimeric IL2 receptor complex, IL2R$\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$, reducing its ability to bind and activate the heterotrimer. The IL2R$\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$ complex is constitutively expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs). Therefore, without the use of mutations, PEGylation reduces the affinity for IL2R$\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$ to a greater extent than for IL2R$\beta$$\gamma$, the receptor complex predominant on CD8 T cells. NKTR-214 treatment in vivo favors activation of CD8 T cells over Tregs in the tumor microenvironment to provide anti-tumor efficacy in multiple syngeneic models. Mechanistic modeling based on in vitro and in vivo kinetic data provides insight into the mechanism of NKTR-214 pharmacology. The model reveals that conjugated-IL2 protein derived from NKTR-214 occupy IL-2R$\beta$$\gamma$ to a greater extent compared to free-IL2 protein. The model accurately describes the sustained in vivo signaling observed after a single dose of NKTR-214 and explains how the properties of NKTR-214 impart a unique kinetically-controlled immunological mechanism of action.},

IL-2 is of considerable therapeutic interest, but harnessing its actions in a controllable manner remains a challenge. Previously,we have engineered an IL-2 "superkine" with enhanced affinity for IL-2R$\beta$. Here, we describe next-generation IL-2 variants that function as "receptor signaling clamps." They retained high affinity for IL-2R$\beta$, inhibiting binding of endogenous IL-2, but their interaction with $\gamma${\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} was weakened, attenuating IL-2R$\beta$-$\gamma${\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} heterodimerization. These IL-2 analogs acted as partial agonists and differentially affected lymphocytes poised at distinct activation thresholds. Moreover, one variant, H9-RETR, antagonized IL-2 and IL-15 better than blocking antibodies against IL-2R$\alpha$ or IL-2R$\beta$. Furthermore, this mutein prolonged survival in a model of graft-versus-host disease and blocked spontaneous proliferation of smoldering adult Tcell leukemia (ATL) Tcells. This receptor-clamping approach might be a general mechanism-based strategy for engineering cytokine partial agonists for therapeutic immunomodulation.},

In the bispecific format with arms targeting both TfR and $\beta$-secretase 1 (BACE1), altering the affinity to TfR has been shown to impact systemic exposure and safety profiles. In this work, a mathematical model incorporating pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) and safety profiles is developed for bispecific TfR/BACE1 antibodies with a range of affinities to TfR in order to guide candidate selection. The model captures the dependence of both systemic and brain exposure on TfR affinity and the subsequent impact on brain A$\beta$40lowering and circulating reticulocyte levels. Model simulations identify the optimal affinity for the TfR arm of the bispecific to maximize A$\beta$ reduction while maintaining reticulocyte levels.

abstract = {Abstract: The failure of the cellular immune response to stop solid tumor growth has been the subject of much research. Although the mechanisms for tumor evasion of immune response are poorly understood, one viable explanation is that tumor-killing lymphocytes cannot reach the tumor cells in sufficient quantity to keep the tumor in check. Recently, the use of bifunctional antibodies (BFAs) has been proposed as a way to direct immune cells to the tumor: one arm of the antibody is specific for a known tumor-associated antigen and the other for a lymphocyte marker such as CD3. Injecting this BFA should presumably result in cross-linking of lymphocytes (either endogenous or adoptively transferred) with tumor cells, thereby enhancing therapy. Results from such an approach, however, are often disappointing — frequently there is no benefit gained by using the BFA. We have analyzed the retargeting of endogenous effector cells by BFA using a physiologically based whole-body pharmacokinetic model that accounts for interactions between all relevant species in the various organs and tumor. Our results suggest that the design of the BFA is critical and the binding constants of the antigen and lymphocyte binding epitopes need to be optimized for successful therapy.},

abstract = {Until recently, most therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were designed to bind only one target. However, several existing mAbs bind to soluble and membrane forms of the same receptor. Moreover, design of bi-specific and multi-specific proteins that bind to more than one target is a promising direction of drug design. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs may be described by the target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD). This work extended the TMDD model to drugs that bind more than one target. The quasi-steady-state (QSS) and Michaelis-Menten (MM) approximations of the model were also derived. Identifiability of model parameters was studied by simulations. The drug and target parameters used in simulations were chosen to imitate a monoclonal antibody that binds to the soluble (S) and membrane-bound (M) targets. The data were simulated for 224 subjects using the full TMDD model and dosing that mimicked typical Phase I and Phase II designs with rich sampling. Four population pharmacokinetic models were fitted to the free (unbound) drug and total (unbound and bound to the drug) S-target data: a one-target QSS model that simultaneously described the free drug and the total S-target (M1), a model with parallel linear and MM elimination that described the free drug combined with a separate S-target model that utilized the free drug concentrations but did not influence them (M2), a two-target QSS model where the S-target was described by the QSS approximation while the contribution of the M-target was described by the MM elimination term (M3), and a two-target full TMDD model (M4). The influence of relative contributions of the S and M-targets to target-mediated elimination on identifiability of the model parameters was investigated. The influence of assay sensitivity and availability of the total rather than free drug concentration measurements were also investigated. The results indicated that for the dosing regimens and system parameters investigated in this work the pharmacokinetic data alone did not allow to distinguish influences of the two targets. When the drug and S-target data were available, the model M1 described the data with the deficiencies of the fit visible only at the lowest dose level. However, the parameter estimates were strongly biased. The model M2 improved the fit and provided the precise estimates of the S-target parameters. However, no information concerning the M-target could be obtained from this model. The model M3 provided an excellent description of the data and the unbiased estimates of all the parameters. It also provided the unbiased estimates of change from baseline of the unobservable M-target concentrations. The models M1-M3 were robust while M4 was unstable despite the prohibitively long run time. The results were similar when the total rather than free drug was measured. The M-target parameters were estimated only when M-target elimination was at least comparable to S-target elimination. Improvement of the assay sensitivity has not resulted in marked improvement of the parameter estimates. In summary, for the cases investigated in this work the QSS approximation of the two-target TMDD model provided the unbiased and robust estimates of all the relevant TMDD parameters.},

abstract = {Tregs imprint an early immunotolerant tumor environment that prevents effective antitumor immune responses. Using transcriptomics of tumor tissues, we identified early upregulation of VEGF and TGF-$\beta$ pathways compatible with tolerance imprinting. Silencing of VEGF or TGF-$\beta$ in tumor cells induced early and pleiotropic modulation of immune-related transcriptome signatures in tumor tissues. These were surprisingly similar for both silenced tumors and related to common downstream effects on Tregs. Silencing of VEGF or TGF-$\beta$ resulted in dramatically delayed tumor growth, associated with decreased Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increased effector T cell activation in tumor infiltrates. Strikingly, co-silencing of TGF-$\beta$ and VEGF led to a substantial spontaneous tumor eradication rate and the combination of their respective inhibitory drugs was synergistic. VEGF and/or TGF-$\beta$ silencing also restored tumor sensitivity to tumor-specific cell therapies and markedly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 treatment. Thus, TGF-$\beta$ and VEGF cooperatively control the tolerant environment of tumors and are targets for improved cancer immunotherapies.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterised by resistance of peripheral tissues to insulin and a relative deficiency of insulin secretion. To find out which is the earliest or primary determinant of disease, we used a minimum model of glucose disposal and insulin secretion based on intravenous glucose tolerance tests to estimate insulin sensitivity (SI), glucose effectiveness (ie, insulin-independent glucose removal rate, SG), and first-phase and second-phase beta-cell responsiveness in normoglycaemic offspring of couples who both had type 2 diabetes. 155 subjects from 86 families were followed-up for 6-25 years. More than 10 years before the development of diabetes, subjects who developed the disease had lower values of both SI (mean 3{\textperiodcentered}2 [SD 2{\textperiodcentered}4] vs 8{\textperiodcentered}1 [6{\textperiodcentered}7] 10-3 I min-1 pmol-1 insulin; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and SG (1{\textperiodcentered}6 [0{\textperiodcentered}9] vs 2{\textperiodcentered}3 [1{\textperiodcentered}2] 10-2 min-1, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) than did those who remained normoglycaemic). For the subjects with both SI and SG below the group median, the cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes during the 25 years was 76{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 54-99). By contrast, no subject with both SI and SG above the median developed the disease. Subjects with low SI/high SG or high SI/low SG had intermediate risks. Insulin secretion, especially first phase, tended to be increased rather than decreased in this prediabetic phase and was appropriate for the level of insulin resistance. The development of type 2 diabetes is preceded by and predicted by defects in both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent glucose uptake; the defects are detectable when the patients are normoglycaemic and in most cases more than a decade before diagnosis of disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a large Dutch multiethnic cohort. METHODS: We used a 2-step testing procedure to stratify 2031 consecutive pregnant women into 4 groups according to American Diabetes Association criteria: (a) normal glucose tolerance (NGT), (b) mild gestational hyperglycemia (MGH), (c) GDM without early postpartum diabetes within 6 months of delivery (GDM1), and (d) GDM with early postpartum diabetes (GDM2). Antepartum and postpartum clinical characteristics and measures of glucose tolerance were documented. RESULTS: Overall, 1627 women had NGT, 237 had MGH, 156 had GDM1, and 11 had GDM2. Prepregnancy body mass index values progressively increased from NGT to MGH to GDM1. The fasting plasma glucose concentration, the 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) area under the curve, and the mean glucose concentration during the OGTT all increased progressively among the 4 groups. The fasting C-peptide concentration displayed an inverted-U pattern, with a maximum at a mean plasma glucose concentration during the OGTT of 9.6 mmol/L in the transition from GDM1 to GDM2. The fasting C-peptide/glucose concentration ratio decreased by 42{\%} in GDM patients compared with NGT patients, whereas the ratios in MGH and NGT women were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive metabolic derangement of glucose tolerance 1st detected during pregnancy mimics the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. In addition, our results imply an impaired basal glucose effectiveness in the early prediabetic state. To explain the parallel in both metabolic derangements, we postulate that GDM, like type 2 diabetes, is attributable to the same inherited mitochondrial dysfunction.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: We investigated whether a reduced incretin effect, as observed in patients with type 2 diabetes, can be detected in high-risk individuals, such as women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (pGDM). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 102 women without diabetes with pGDM and 15 control participants without pGDM and with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) underwent a 4 h 75 g OGTT and an isoglycaemic i.v. glucose infusion (IIGI). Women with pGDM were classified as having NGT or prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance). Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the Matsuda index and HOMA2-IR and the incretin effect was calculated from insulin responses during the study (100{\%} x [AUCinsulin,OGTT - AUCinsulin,IIGI]/AUCinsulin,OGTT). Results: Sixty-three of the 102 women with pGDM (62{\%}) had prediabetes (median [interquartile range]: age, 38.3 [6.5] years; BMI, 32.1 [5.8] kg/m2) and 39 women (38{\%}) had NGT (age, 39.5 [5.6] years; BMI, 31.0 [6.7] kg/m2). Control participants (n = 15) were not significantly different from the pGDM group with regards to age (39.2 [7.4] years) and BMI (28.8 [9.2] kg/m2). Compared with women with NGT and control participants, women with prediabetes had lower insulin sensitivity, as measured by the Matsuda index (3.0 [2.4] vs 5.0 [2.6] vs 1.5 [1.8], respectively; p {\textless}0.001). The incretin effect was 55.3{\%} [27.8], 73.8{\%} [19.0] and 76.7{\%} [24.6] in women with prediabetes, women with normal glucose tolerance and control participants, respectively (p {\textless}0.01). Conclusion/interpretation: Prediabetes was highly prevalent in women with pGDM, and alterations in the incretin effect were detected in this group before the development of type 2 diabetes.

Data show that increasing levels of plasma glucose are associated with birth weight above the 90th percentile, cord blood serum C-peptide level above the 90th percentile, and, to a lesser degree, primary cesarean deliveries and neonatal hypoglycemia. Risk factors for GDM include history of macrosomia, strong family history of diabetes, and obesity. Screening protocol for GDM is controversial; some recommend a universal approach, whereas others exempt low-risk patients. The cornerstone of management is glycemic control. Quality nutritional intake is essential. Patients with GDM who cannot control their glucose levels with diet alone will require insulin. There is no consensus as to when to initiate insulin therapy, but more conservative guidelines are in place to help minimize macrosomia and its associated risks to the infant. It is generally recommended that pregnancies complicated by GDM do not go beyond term.},

abstract = {The ability of hyperglycaemia to enhance glucose uptake was evaluated in 9 non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM), 7 insulin-dependent (IDDM) diabetic subjects, and in 6 young and 9 older normal volunteers. Following overnight insulin-induced euglycaemia, a sequential three-step hyperglycaemic clamp (+ 2.8 + 5.6, and + 11.2 mmol/l above baseline) was performed with somatostatin plus replacing doses of basal insulin and glucagon, 3-3H-glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry. In the control subjects as a whole, glucose disposal increased at each hyperglycaemic step (13.1 +/- 0.6, 15.7 +/- 0.7, and 26.3 +/- 1.1 mumol/kg.min). In NIDDM (10.5 +/- 0.2, 12.1 +/- 1.0, and 17.5 +/- 1.1 mumol/kg.min), and IDDM (11.2 +/- 0.8, 12.9 +/- 1.0, and 15.6 +/- 1.1 mumol/kg.min) glucose disposal was lower during all three steps (p {\textless} 0.05-0.005). Hepatic glucose production declined proportionally to plasma glucose concentration to a similar extent in all four groups of patients. In control subjects, hyperglycaemia stimulated glucose oxidation (+4.4 +/- 0.7 mumol/kg.min) only at +11.2 mmol/l (p {\textless} 0.05), while non-oxidative glucose metabolism increased at each hyperglycaemic step (+3.1 +/- 0.7; +3.5 +/- 0.9, and +10.8 +/- 1.7 mumol/kg.min; all p {\textless} 0.05). In diabetic patients, no increment in glucose oxidation was elicited even at the highest hyperglycaemic plateau (IDDM = +0.5 +/- 1.5; NIDDM = +0.2 +/- 0.6 mumol/kg.min) and non-oxidative glucose metabolism was hampered (IDDM = +1.8 +/- 1.5, +3.1 +/- 1.7, and +4.3 +/- 1.8; NIDDM = +0.7 +/- 0.6, 2.1 +/- 0.9, and +7.0 +/- 0.8 mumol/kg.min; p {\textless} 0.05-0.005). Blood lactate concentration increased and plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) fell in control (p {\textless} 0.05) but not in diabetic subjects. The increments in blood lactate were correlated with the increase in non-oxidative glucose disposal and with the decrease in plasma NEFA. In conclusion: 1) the ability of hyperglycaemia to promote glucose disposal is impaired in NIDDM and IDDM; 2) stimulation of glucose oxidation and non-oxidative glucose metabolism accounts for glucose disposal; 3) both pathways of glucose metabolism are impaired in diabetic patients; 4) impaired ability of hyperglycaemia to suppress plasma NEFA is present in these patients. These results suggest that glucose resistance, that is the ability of glucose itself to promote glucose utilization, is impaired in both IDDM and NIDDM patients.},

Undermodeling, i.e., use of single- instead of two-compartment description of glucose kinetics, has been advocated to explain these limitations. We describe a new two-compartment minimal model (2CMM) into which we incorporate certain available knowledge on glucose kinetics. 2CMM is numerically identified using a Bayesian approach. Twenty-two standard IVGTT (0.30 g/kg) in normal humans were analyzed. In six subjects, the clamp-based index of insulin sensitivity (ScI) was also measured. 2CMM glucose effectiveness (S2G) and insulin sensitivity (S2I) were, respectively, 60{\%} lower (P {\textless} 0.0001) and 35{\%} higher (P {\textless} 0.0001) than the corresponding 1CMM S1G and S1I indexes: 2.81 +/- 0.29 (SE) vs. S1G = 4.27 +/- 0.33 ml. min(-1). kg(-1) and S2I = 11.67 +/- 1.71 vs. S1I = 8.68 +/- 1.62 10(2) ml. min(-1). kg(-1) per microU/ml.

abstract = {Population approaches, traditionally employed in pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies, have shown value also in the context of glucose-insulin metabolism models by providing more accurate individual parameters estimates and a compelling statistical framework for the analysis of between-subject variability (BSV). In this work, the advantages of population techniques are further explored by proposing integration of covariates in the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) glucose minimal model analysis. A previously published dataset of 204 healthy subjects, who underwent insulin-modified IVGTTs, was analyzed in NONMEM, and relevant demographic information about each subject was employed to explain part of the BSV observed in parameter values. Demographic data included height, weight, sex, and age, but also basal glycemia and insulinemia, and information about amount and distribution of body fat. On the basis of nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, age, visceral abdominal fat, and basal insulinemia were significant predictors for SI (insulin sensitivity), whereas only age and basal insulinemia were significant for P2 (insulin action). The volume of distribution correlated with sex, age, percentage of total body fat, and basal glycemia, whereas no significant covariate was detected to explain variability in SG (glucose effectiveness). The introduction of covariates resulted in a significant shrinking of the unexplained BSV, especially for SI and P2 and considerably improved the model fit. These results offer a starting point for speculation about the physiological meaning of the relationships detected and pave the way for the design of less invasive and less expensive protocols for epidemiological studies of glucose-insulin metabolism.},

It began with modeling of the insulin-glucose system, and progressed to large-scale in silico experiments, and automated closed-loop control (artificial pancreas). Here, we follow these engineering efforts through the last, almost 50 years. We begin with the now classic minimal modeling approach and discuss a number of subsequent models, which have recently resulted in the first in silico simulation model accepted as substitute to animal trials in the quest for optimal diabetes control. We then review metabolic monitoring, with a particular emphasis on the new continuous glucose sensors, on the analyses of their time-series signals, and on the opportunities that they present for automation of diabetes control. Finally, we review control strategies that have been successfully employed in vivo or in silico, presenting a promise for the development of a future artificial pancreas and, in particular, discuss a modular architecture for building closed-loop control systems, including insulin delivery and patient safety supervision layers. We conclude with a brief discussion of the unique interactions between human physiology, behavioral events, engineering modeling and control relevant to diabetes.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the relative contribution of insulin-dependent mechanisms vs. mechanisms independent on dynamic insulin for glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet. C57BL/6J mice underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (1 g/kg glucose) at 1 wk and 1, 3, and 10 mo after initiation of a high-fat diet (58{\%} fat; control diet 11{\%} fat) to measure glucose effectiveness (S(G)) and disposition index (DI), i.e., insulin sensitivity (S(I)) times early or total insulin secretion. Glucose disappearance (K(G)) and S(I) were reduced in high-fat-fed mice at all time points. Total (50 min) insulin secretion was sufficiently increased at all time points to compensate for the reduced S(I), as judged by normal DI(50) (min). In contrast, early (10 min) insulin secretion was not sufficiently increased; DI(10) (min) was reduced after 1, 3, and 10 mo. S(G) was reduced after 1 wk; the reduction persisted throughout the study period. Thus glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet is, in early phases, solely explained by reduced glucose effectiveness, whereas insufficient early insulin secretion is of importance after long-term feeding.},

@article{Tonelli2005,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: 'Glucose effectiveness' refers to the ability of glucose per se to suppress endogenous glucose production and stimulate glucose uptake. In addition to the inhibitory effects of insulin on endogenous glucose production, rising glucose levels have important direct effects on glucose homeostasis. The loss of glucose effectiveness in type 2 diabetes mellitus contributes importantly to hyperglycemia in those individuals. Given the rapidly increasing incidence and serious complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, understanding the regulation of glucose effectiveness has great potential therapeutic benefits. RECENT FINDINGS: The loss of this important regulation appears to be secondary to the chronic 'diabetic milieu' in type 2 diabetes mellitus, which includes elevated plasma glucose and free fatty acid levels. Glucose effectiveness is completely restored by normalizing plasma free fatty acid levels. Increased free fatty acid availability stimulates gluconeogenesis and alters flux through key hepatic enzymes. It is likely that at least part of this regulation is through central pathways. In addition, hormones that may exert important effects on hepatic glucose effectiveness include cortisol, insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1. The effectiveness of glucose to stimulate glucose uptake is impaired by elevated free fatty acid levels and may be enhanced by glucagon-like peptide 1. SUMMARY: The regulation of glucose effectiveness involves a complex interplay of hormonal and metabolic factors, with free fatty acid and glucoregulatory hormones playing key roles. The loss of this regulation in type 2 diabetes mellitus contributes importantly to hyperglycemia, and may largely be caused by increased free fatty acid levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glucose effectiveness (S(g)) is an important component in glucose tolerance. Values of S(g) using "open loop" glucose kinetic computer programs are usually higher compared to closed loop method (CLM) programs that incorporate insulin secretion modeling. We aimed to test whether these differences are caused by (1) inclusion of insulin secretion modeling or (2) the method of representing plasma insulin values in the first few minutes of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). METHODS: FSIGTs without insulin supplementation were performed in six healthy volunteers, and the Bergman minimal model was fitted to the data using the simulation and modeling program SAAM. RESULTS: The CLM, which represents the insulin data in the first few minutes by a best-fit curve extrapolated to the y-axis, yielded a significantly lower S(g) than the approach similar to the computer program MINMOD, where the first few minutes of insulin data are represented by a line joining the basal to the peak values (1.55 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.97 +/- 0.27 [SE] x 10(-2)/min, P {\textless} 0.05). This second analysis was then repeated while forcing the program to represent the insulin data after the insulin peak in the same way as in the CLM, obtaining an almost identical result for S(g) (1.99 +/- 0.29). Insulin sensitivity was not significantly affected. CONCLUSIONS: The higher S(g) estimates are caused by the method of representing the first few minutes of insulin data rather than by the incorporation of insulin secretion modeling. It is, therefore, important to know how the early insulin data are represented when comparing results from different computer modeling programs.},

abstract = {Glucose effectiveness is an important determinant of glucose tolerance that can be derived from minimal model analysis of an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). However, recent evidence suggests that glucose effectiveness is overestimated by minimal model analysis. Here we compare a new model-independent estimate of glucose effectiveness with the minimal model estimate by reanalyzing published data in which insulin-dependent diabetic subjects were each given IVGTTs under two conditions (Quon, M. J., C. Cochran, S. I. Taylor, and R. C. Eastman. Diabetes 43: 890-896, 1994). In one case, a basal insulin level was maintained (BI-IVGTT). In the second case, a dynamic insulin response was recreated (DI-IVGTT). Our results show that minimal model glucose effectiveness is very similar to the model-independent measurement during a BI-IVGTT but is three times higher during a DI-IVGTT. To investigate the causes of minimal model overestimation in the presence of a dynamic insulin response, Monte Carlo simulation studies on a two-compartment model of glucose kinetics with various insulin response patterns were performed. Results suggest that minimal model overestimation is due to single-compartment representation of glucose kinetics that results in a critical oversimplification in the presence of increasingly dynamic insulin secretion patterns.},

Most of the differences associated with age are in fact due to differences in size. Additional considerations are required to describe the processes of maturation of clearance processes and postnatal changes in body composition. Application of standard approaches to reporting pharmacokinetic parameters is essential for comparative human pharmacokinetic studies from babies to adults. A standardized comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in children and adults is shown for 46 drugs. Appropriate size scaling shows that children (over 2 years old) are similar to adults. Maturation changes are generally completed within the first 2 years of postnatal life; consequently babies may be considered as immature children, whereas children are just small adults. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 102:2941–2952, 2013},

abstract = {The major function of the heart is to maintain per-fusion of peripheral organs, matching their demand during both normal and stress conditions. To accom-plish this task in the presence of increased preload or afterload, the heart and the individual cardiomyocytes often undergo enlargement, a condition termed hyper-trophy. Cardiac hypertrophy increases contractility, at least initially, through the addition of sarcomere units in parallel. In addition, increases in left ventricular wall thickness decrease left ventricular wall stress fol-lowing Laplace's law, thereby maintaining cardiac effi-ciency. Cardiac hypertrophy is also accompanied by qualitative changes, namely, changes in gene expres-sion, which induce changes in metabolism, contrac-tility, and cardiomyocyte survival. There are two types of hypertrophy: physiological and pathological (Fig. 1). Both hypertrophy types initially develop as an adaptive response to cardiac stress, but they differ greatly in terms of the underlying molecular mechanisms, car-diac phenotype, and prognosis. Physiological hyper-trophy maintains cardiac function over time, whereas pathological hypertrophy is accompanied by adverse cardiovascular events, including heart failure, arrhyth-mias, and death. The cardiac phenotype of pathologi-cal hypertrophy varies and can manifest as either heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) 1 . In this Review, we summarize the characteristics of physiological and pathological hypertrophy and dis-cuss the underlying signalling pathways, with particu-lar emphasis on the emerging mechanisms described in the past decade that mediate the two forms of cardiac hypertrophy. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of physiological and patho-logical hypertrophy might lead to novel therapeutic approaches for reversing pathological hypertrophy and preventing detrimental outcomes.},

abstract = {The unlabeled (cold) minimal model (MM) and the labeled (hot) minimal model (HMM) are a powerful tool to investigate in vivo metabolism from a standard intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) or hot IVGTT (HIVGTT). They allow to estimate metabolic indexes of the glucose-insulin system, namely glucose effectiveness (GE) and insulin sensitivity (IS) (of uptake and production those of MM, and of uptake only those of HMM). Here, the consequences of the single-compartment glucose kinetics approximation used in the MM's are investigated via Monte Carlo simulation, using a physiologic reference model (RM) of the system. RM allows to generate noisy synthetic plasma concentrations of glucose, tracer glucose, and insulin during IVGTT and HIVGTT, which are then analyzed with MM and HMM. The MM and HMM GE and IS are then compared with the RM ones. Results of 400 runs show that: 1) correlation of MM GE with the RM index is weak; 2) MM IS is well correlated with the RM index, but severely underestimates it; 3) HMM clearance rate is correlated with RM clearance; and 4) HMM IS is well correlated and only slightly overestimates the RM index. These results demonstrate that GE of MM is most affected by the single-compartment approximation and the indexes of HMM are more robust than those of MM.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disturbance of gastric emptying leads to a variety of symptoms. Furthermore, gastric motility disorders might play a role in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia. In previous studies 13C breath tests were validated as non-invasive tools in the measurement of gastric emptying time. So far, reliable reference values of healthy subjects are missing and the impact of constitutional traits (age, sex, body mass index [BMI]) needs to be clarified. METHODS: A study was conducted in 90 healthy individuals (45 men, 45 women) that assessed the correlation of parameters of gastric emptying (half gastric emptying time [T1/2] and time of fastest gastric emptying [T(lag)]) with age, sex and BMI for fluid and solid test meals by 13C breath tests. 100 mg of sodium acetate or sodium octanoate, respectively, were used as tracers. Breath probes were analyzed by non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD of half gastric emptying time (T1/2) of a fluid test meal was determined to be 80.5 +/- 22.1 min and for T(lag) to be 40.3 +/- 10.2 min. However, the T1/2 and T(lag) of solid meals did not fit to normal distribution and thus median and percentiles were determined. The median time of T1/2 for solids was 127 min (25-75{\%} percentiles: 112.0-168.3 min) and 81.5 min for T(lag) (25-75{\%} percentiles: 65.5-102.0 min). No significant correlation was found between gastric emptying and age, sex or BMI. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine gastric emptying in an adequate number of healthy subjects by 13C breath tests. No significant correlation was found with age, sex and BMI. Although there is considerable standard deviation in gastric emptying time, these results may nevertheless serve as reference values for further studies.},

abstract = {Background After laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), many patients suffer from dumping syndrome. Oral glucose tolerance tests are usually carried out with 50–75 g of glucose. The aim of this study was to examine whether minimal glucose loads of 10 g and 25 g induce a reliable secretion of satiation peptides without dumping symptoms after LRYGB. In addition, lean and obese controls were examined. Objective The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low oral glucose loads on incretin release and gastric emptying. Setting All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon (RP) at the St. Claraspital Basel in Switzerland. Oral glucose challenges were carried out at the University Hospital of Basel (Phase 1 Research Unit). Methods Eight patients 10±.4 weeks after LRYGB (PostOP; body mass index [BMI]: 38.6 kg/m2±1.7) as well as 12 lean controls (LC; BMI: 21.8 kg/m2±.6) and 12 obese controls (OC; BMI 38.7 kg/m2±1.3) received 10 g and 25 g of oral glucose. We examined clinical signs of dumping syndrome; plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and peptide tyrosine tyrosine concentrations; and gastric emptying with a 13 C-sodium acetate breath test. Results No signs of dumping were seen in PostOP. Compared with OC, LC showed lower fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide, and lower homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and AUC-180 for insulin and C-peptide. In PostOP, fasting insulin, HOMA and AUC-180 for insulin was lower and no difference was found in fasting C-peptide or AUC-180 for C-peptide compared to OC. There was no significant difference in fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HOMA and AUC-180 for insulin in PostOP compared to LC, but AUC-180 for C-peptide was higher in PostOP. AUC-60 for gut hormones was similar in OC and LC and higher in PostOP compared to OC or LC. gastric emptying was slower in LC and OC compared with PostOP. Conclusion After LRYGB, 25 g oral glucose is well tolerated and leads to reliable secretion of gut hormones. Fasting glucose, insulin and C-peptide are normalized, while glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and peptide tyrosine tyrosine are overcorrected. Pouch emptying is accelerated after LRYGB.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was designed to assess the relationship between gastric emptying of glucose solution and the ensuing plasma concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) in patients having undergone fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 10 male patients the emptying of 50{\%} glucose solution was determined scintigraphically and its relationship with plasma glucose, GLP-1, PYY, and GIP concentrations was studied before and 3 months after fundoplication. RESULTS: In the first 30 min after glucose ingestion, emptying was significantly (p = 0.048) faster after fundoplication than before. Emptying and GLP-1 and GIP correlated: the faster the emptying during the first 30 min the greater the concentrations integrated over that period (p = 0.04; p = 0.01; p = 0.02). Emptying and PYY concentrations were unrelated. In the 120-180 min. period, blood glucose concentrations were lower the faster the emptying in the initial 30 min (p = 0.06) and the entire 50-min recording period (p = 0.03) had been. The GLP-1 concentrations integrated over the first 30 min correlated inversely with the integrated plasma glucose during the third hour after ingestion (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: After fundoplication, gastric emptying may, if accelerated in its initial phases, give rise to greater and earlier increases in plasma glucose, GLP-1, and GIP concentrations and thus to reactive hypoglycemia.},

abstract = {The double sampling gastric aspiration method was used to measure the effect of energy content on the rate of gastric emptying of glucose and soy protein hydrolysate solutions. The net rate of absorption of water from these solutions was assessed using deuterium oxide as a tracer for water. Six healthy male subjects were each studied on four separate occasions using a test drink volume of 600 ml. The half emptying times (t(1/2), median (range)) of the iso-energetic soy protein hydrolysate (6P, 60 g l(-1), 36 (14-39) min) and glucose (7G, 70 g l(-1), 25 (19-29) min) solutions were similar. These two solutions (6P, 7G) delivered energy to the small intestine at similar rates, and resulted in similar rates of accumulation of the deuterium tracer in the circulation. The dilute glucose solution (LG, 23 g l(-1)) was emptied faster (t(1/2) 13 (11-19) min) and resulted in a faster rate of tracer accumulation in the circulation than any of the other solutions, including the iso-osmotic soy protein solution (LG 311 +/- 5 mosmol kg(-1), 6P 321 +/- 24 mosmol kg(-1)). The concentrated soy protein hydrolysate solution (12P, 120 g l(-1)) emptied more slowly (t(1/2) 80 (44-120) min) than the more dilute solutions. The rate of energy delivery to the small intestine from 12P was similar to that from 6P for the first 50 min after ingestion, and similar to that from 7G at all sample points. These results indicate that the iso-energetic solutions of glucose and soy protein hydrolysate used in this study are emptied from the stomach at similar rates and result in similar rates of fluid availability after ingestion.},

Predicted concentrations of digoxin in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and plasma were consistent with experimental observations in conscious rats after an intravenous dose. The model was extended to describe digoxin concentrations in the plasma of bile duct-ligated rats and ureter-ligated rats, simply by modifying appropriate clearance parameters.

Aims: To evaluate the effects of digoxin in patients with the newly described phenotype of heart failure (HF) and mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), attributed to mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Methods and results: We carried out a retrospective analysis of the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial which had 7788 patients available for analysis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ranging between 3{\%} and 85{\%}. We compared the effect of digoxin to placebo in three mutually exclusive groups of patients defined by LVEF category:  {\textless} 40{\%} (HF with reduced LVEF, HFrEF, n = 5874), 40-49{\%} (HFmrEF, n = 1195) and ≥50{\%} (HF with preserved LVEF, HFpEF, n = 719). The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalisation. Patients with HFmrEF resembled patients with HFrEF, more than those with HFpEF, with respect to age, sex and aetiology but were more like HFpEF patients with respect to blood pressure and the prevalence of hypertension. Event rates in patients with HFmrEF were similar to those in HFpEF and much lower than in HFrEF. Digoxin reduced the primary endpoint in patients with HFrEF, mainly due to reduced HF hospitalisation: the digoxin/placebo hazard ratio (HR) for HF hospitalisation was 0.71 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.77]. The digoxin/placebo HR for HF hospitalisation in patients with HFmrEF was 0.80 (95{\%} CI 0.63-1.03) and 0.85 (95{\%} CI 0.62-1.17) in those with HFpEF. The digoxin/placebo HR for the composite of HF death or HF hospitalisation was 0.74 (95{\%} CI 0.68-0.81) in HFrEF, 0.83 (95{\%} CI 0.66-1.05) in HFmrEF and 0.88 (95{\%} CI 0.65-1.19) in HFpEF. Conclusions: In this study, event rates in patients with HFmrEF were closer to those in HFpEF than HFrEF. Digoxin had most effect on HF hospitalisation in patients with HFrEF, an intermediate effect in HFmrEF, and the smallest effect in HFpEF.},

@article{Braunwald1985,
abstract = {Although it has been known for more than a century that digitalis glycosides exert a powerful beneficial effect on patients with heart failure, atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular rate, it was believed for many years that the drug exerts this clinical effect primarily by slowing the heart rate. It was also thought that the extra-cardiac vascular actions of digitalis might be responsible for its therapeutic effect. It has now been established that cardiac glycosides cause arteriolar and venous constriction in a variety of mammalian species including human beings, and that this vasoconstriction involves the coronary vascular bed as well, but it is believed that these actions are not responsible for any beneficial clinical effect. A variety of investigations on cardiac muscle in vitro, anesthetized and conscious dogs and anesthetized and conscious human subjects have shown that cardiac glycosides improve the contractility of failing mammalian myocardium. It has become clear that digitalis also stimulates the contractility of the nonfailing heart. The degree of augmentation of contractility induced by cardiac glycosides is related inversely to the baseline contractile state. Myocardial oxygen consumption, which is increased in the normal heart by the positive inotropic action of glycosides, is actually reduced or remains constant in the failing heart. Cardiac glycosides increase the contractility of the globally ischemic heart, but their actions in chronic ischemic heart disease with regional impairment of function are complex. Deterioration of segmental performance occurs in ischemic and necrotic segments, while improvement of contractility occurs in adjacent normal segments. A modest improvement in left ventricular pump performance occurs in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease with impairment of global left ventricular function. There has been considerable debate concerning the clinical value of digitalis therapy in heart failure. Simple withdrawal of digitalis resulted in no clinical deterioration in many patients with mild to moderate heart failure. However, in patients with more severe impairment of cardiac function, aggravation of heart failure occurred after digitalis withdrawal, and striking clinical improvement was noted when the drug was readminis-tered. Thus, cardiac glycosides are relatively weak inotropic agents, have a low therapeutic ratio and are moderately effective in heart failure secondary to ventricular volume overload. However, when properly used in patients with severe heart failure and sinus rhythm, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation, cardiac glycosides improve both cardiac performance and the clinical state and can be administered effectively for years. {\textcopyright} 1985, American College of Cardiology Foundation.

abstract = {Calcium chloride (CaCl2) alone is an ineffective antidote in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses. Digoxin has been evaluated as a therapy to increase the effectiveness of calcium in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses. Objective: To determine if there is a dose-dependent hemodynamic effect of digoxin in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl2. Methods: Eight dogs were instrumented to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures, and left ventricular pressures. Verapamil toxicity (50{\%} decrease in mean arterial pressure) was induced with verapamil 6 mg/kg/hr and maintained for 30 minutes by titrating the verapamil rate. Following verapamil toxicity, each dog received one dose of digoxin equivalent to 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 times the loading dose of digoxin (0.009 mg/kg). The verapamil rate was changed to 4 mg/kg/hr and continued for the next five hours. CaCl2boluses were given (0.5 g immediately following verapamil toxicity and 1 g at one, two, and three hours). Measurements were compared with the loading dose of digoxin using linear regression analysis. Results: Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure at 4 hours (10.23 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95{\%} CI = 2.74 to 17.73), 4 hours, 15 minutes (13.9 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95{\%} CI = 8.75 to 19.01), and 5 hours (17.04 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95{\%} CI = 1.76 to 32.32). Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in maximal ventricular pressure at the end of hour 3 (8.55 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95{\%} CI = 3.41 to 13.69), 3 hours, 15 minutes (11.81 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95{\%} CI = 4.89 to 18.73), hour 4 (8.26 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95{\%} CI = 1.03 to 15.48), and 4 hours, 15 minutes (9.74 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95{\%} CI = 4.47 to 15.00). The authors were unable to detect a dose-dependent increase in other parameters, including diastolic relaxation (diastolic change in pressure over time) and time to onset of death. No ventricular arrhythmias developed in any dogs. Conclusions: There is a dose-dependent effect of digoxin on systolic blood pressure and maximal ventricular pressure in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl2.},

Digoxin is now considered an outdated and potentially dangerous drug and while effective in the mentioned conditions, is rarely used. The aim of the study was to compare the therapeutic effects of ivabradine in diastolic heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function. Patients were assigned to ivabradine or digoxin according to a randomization cross-over design. Data were single-blind analyzed. The analysis was performed using an intention-to-treat method. Forty-two coronary patients were selected. In spite of maximally tolerated therapy with renin-antagonists, diuretics and ?-blockers, they had congestive diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function. Both ivabradine and digoxin had positive effects on dyspnea, Nterminal natriuretic peptide, heart rate, duration of 6-min. walk-test and signs of diastolic dysfunction, but digoxin was high-statistically more effective. Side-effects were irrelevant. Data were obtained in a single-center and from 42 patients with ischemic etiology of heart failure. The number of patients is small and does not allow assessing mortality. In coronary patients with symptomatic diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function low-dose digoxin was significantly more effective than ivabradine and is much cheaper. One should be more critical about ivabradine and low-dose digoxin in diastolic heart failure. To avoid possible negative effects on the cardiac function and a severe reduction of the cardiac output the resting heart rate should not be decreased to {\&}lt;65 beats/min.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Objective: Studies on the effects of digoxin in patients with right ventricular failure and normal left ventricular function have not been performed. We evaluated the short-term effects of digoxin administration in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension on hemodynamics, neurohormones, and baroreceptor responsiveness. Design: This was a prospective study with patients serving as their own controls. Setting: University Hospital Intensive Care Unit with central monitoring. Patients: Seventeen patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and symptomatic heart failure were enrolled. Interventions: Following baseline hemodynamics, neurohormonal samples were drawn and the heart rate response to change in blood pressure following a challenge of phenylephrine and nitroprusside were recorded. One mg of intravenous digoxin was given and the measurements repeated after 2 hours. Results: Following digoxin there was a significant increase in cardiac output (3.49±1.2 to 3.81±1.2 L/min., p=0.028), a significant fall in norepinephrine (680±89 to 580±85 pg/ml, p=.013), and a significant increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (311±44 to 421±9 pg/ml, p=0.01). All of the patients had changes in heart rate and blood pressure following phenylephrine and nitroprusside challenge, but there was no significant difference in the change in heart rate response to change in blood pressure when rechallenged after digoxin treatment. Conclusion: Digoxin produces a modest increase in cardiac output in patients with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure, as well as a significant reduction in circulating norepinephrine. No detectable effects of digoxin on baroreceptor responsiveness were apparent. The use of digoxin in pulmonary hypertension is warranted.

abstract = {Purpose: To compare the performance of the standard lag time model (LAG model) with the performance of an analytical solution of the transit compartment model (TRANSIT model) in the evaluation of four pharmacokinetic studies with four different compounds. Methods: The population pharmacokinetic analyses were per-formed using NONMEM on concentration–time data of glibenclamide, furosemide, amiloride, and moxonidine. In the TRANSIT model, the optimal number of transit compartments was estimated from the data. This was based on an analytical solu-tion for the change in drug concentration arising from a series of transit compartments with the same first-order transfer rate between each compartment. Goodness-of-fit was assessed by the decrease in objective function value (OFV) and by inspection of diag-nostic graphs. Results: With the TRANSIT model, the OFV was significantly lower and the goodness-of-fit was markedly improved in the absorption phase compared with the LAG model for all drugs. The parameter estimates related to the absorption dif-fered between the two models while the estimates of the pharmacokinetic disposition parameters were similar. Conclusion: Based on these results, the TRANSIT model is 123 712 J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn (2007) 34:711–726 an attractive alternative for modeling drug absorption delay, especially when a LAG model poorly describes the drug absorption phase or is numerically unstable.},

abstract = {The duration of the systolic time intervals in nondigitalized patients with heart failure was determined from simultaneous fast speed recordings of the electrocardiogram, phonocardiogram, and carotid arterial pulsation. These were compared with the systolic time intervals corrected for heart rate and sex in 211 normal subjects. The failing left ventricle is characterized by a prolongation in the systolic pre-ejection period and a diminution in the left ventricular ejection time while total electromechanical systole remains relatively unaltered. Both components of the pre-ejection period, the Q-1 interval and the isovolumic contraction time, were prolonged. These alterations in the phases of systole occur in the absence of a measurable change in ventricular depolarization time. The prolongation in the pre-ejection period is well correlated with the reduced stroke volume and cardiac output in heart failure and is independently augmented by high levels of arterial pressure. The abbreviation in left ventricular ejection time is also correlated significantly with the stroke volume and cardiac output. It is postulated that a defect in the mechanical performance of the heart is responsible for the abnormal systolic time intervals in human heart failure.},

[1] a Thevenin equivalent consisting of a hydromotive pressure source and an internal, source resistance and compliance in paralle{\#} and [2] a time-varying compliance filled from a constant pressure source and ejecting into a load of three components, a central resistor, a compliance, and a peripheral resistance. According to the Thevenin analog, the energy source and the load are matched when the load resistance is T/t times the internal source resistance (T is total cycle length, t is systolic time interval). Both from this model and from the variable compliance model it appears that optimum matching between source and load depends on the compliance of the Windkessel, as low compliance shifts the matching load resistance to a low value. Animal experiments (isolated cat hearts) indicated that both left and right ventricles at normal loads work close to their maxima of output hydraulic power, and, according to experiments in the right ventricle, maximum power output is related to load resistance and compliance as predicted by the above models. From an experimentally determined relationship among instantaneous ventricular pressure.and volume (right ventricle of isolated cat hearts), an optimum load impedance was calculated on the basis of the assumption that the ratio between stroke work and static, potential energy developed in the ventricular cavity is maximum. The optimum load impedance found by this procedure closely resembles the normal input impedance of the cat lung vessel bed.},

abstract = {Many aspects of left ventricular function are explained by considering ventricular pressure–volume characteristics. Contractility is best measured by the slope, Emax, of the end-systolic pressure–volume relationship. Ventricular systole is usefully characterized by a time-varying elastance ($\Delta$P/$\Delta$V). An extended area, the pressure– volume area, subtended by the ventricular pressure– volume loop (useful mechanical work) and the ESPVR (energy expended without mechanical work), is linearly related to myocardial oxygen consumption per beat. For energetically efficient systolic ejection ventricular elastance should be, and is, matched to aortic elastance. Without matching, the fraction of energy expended without mechanical work increases and energy is lost during ejection across the aortic valve. Ventricular function curves, derived from ventricular pressure– volume characteristics, interact with venous return curves to regulate cardiac output. Thus, consideration of ventricular pressure–volume relationships highlight features that allow the heart to efficiently respond to any demand for cardiac output and oxygen delivery. Background},

abstract = {To elucidate the role of venous capacity active changes in short-term cardiovascular homeostasis, a mathematical model of the carotid-sinus baroreflex system has been developed. In the model the cardiovascular system is represented as the series arrangement of six lumped compartments, which synthesize the fundamental hemodynamic properties of the systemic arterial, systemic venous, pulmonary arterial, and pulmonary venous circulations as well as of the left and right cardiac volumes. Cardiac outputs from the left and right ventricles are computed as a function of both downstream arterial pressure (afterload) and upstream atrial pressure (preload). Four distinct feedback regulatory mechanisms, working on systemic arterial resistance, heart rate, systemic venous unstressed volume, and systemic venous compliance, are assumed to operate on the cardiovascular system in response to carotid sinus pressure changes. All model parameters, both in the cardiovascular system and in feedback regulatory mechanisms, have been assigned on the basis of physiological data now available. The model is used here to simulate the pattern of the main hemodynamic quantities in the short time period (1-2 min) after acute carotid sinus activation in vagotomized subjects. Simulation results indicate that the model can reproduce experimental data quite well, with reference both to open-loop experiments and to an acute blood hemorrhage performed in closed-loop conditions. Moreover, computer simulations indicate that active changes in venous unstressed volume are of primary importance in regulating cardiac output and systemic arterial pressure during activation of the carotid sinus baroreflex.},

Sorafenib inhibits the Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor pathways, thus inhibiting cell growth and angiogenesis. Combinations of these two agents are under evaluation for therapy of several cancers. This study examined the effects of everolimus and sorafenib on proliferation of the pancreatic cancer cell lines MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1. Cell growth inhibition was evaluated in vitro for a range of concentrations of the drugs alone and in combination. Maximum inhibition capacity (I (max)) and potency (IC(50)) were determined. The data were analyzed to characterize drug interactions using two mathematical analysis techniques. The Ariens noncompetitive interaction model and Earp model were modified to accommodate alterations in the inhibition parameters of one drug in the presence of another. Sorafenib alone inhibited growth of both cell lines completely (I (max) = 1), with an IC(50) of 5-8 $\mu$M. Maximal inhibition by everolimus alone was only 40{\%} (I (max) = 0.4) in both cell lines, with an IC(50) of 5 nM. Slight antagonistic interaction occurred between the drugs; both analytic methods estimated the interaction term $\Psi$ as greater than 1 for both cell lines. The in vitro data for two pancreatic cancer cell lines suggest that a combination of these two drugs would be no more efficacious than the individual drugs alone, consistent with the drug interaction analysis that indicated slight antagonism for growth inhibition.},

abstract = {The heart-rate response during sustained hand grip was studied in four normal subjects before and after intravenous atropine, propranolol and combined cardiac autonomic blockade with both drugs. The results suggest that the increase in heart rate during the first 20 s is due to para-sympathetic withdrawal, whereas the further increase between 30 s and 180 s is proably mediated by a combination of parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic stimulation. The increases in heart rate during each minute of sustained hand grip were compared in 26 normal subjects, 37 diabetic subjects without and 24 diabetic subjects with proven autonomic neuropathy. In the diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy the increase in heart rate during the first minute was impaired, whereas the increases during the second and third minutes were similar in all three groups. The initial increase in heart rate over the first 30 s of hand grip and the later increase between 30 s and 180 s were compared in nine normal subjects, ten diabetic subjects without and six diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy. The increase during the first 30 s was impaired in the diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy, whereas the later phase of the response was similar in all three groups. It is concluded that impairment of the heart-rate response to sustained hand grip in diabetic autonomic neuropathy is mainly due to impairment of the early parasympathetic phase, but that the presence of cardiac sympathetic damage can also be detected.},

This study examines the blood pressure response to IHG in 71 normal subjects and 76 dysautonomic patients and compares it with the tilt table test. All participants were supine and performed IHG at 30{\%} of maximum contraction for 5 min. Change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the most sensitive and specific measurement in diagnosing abnormals. The multivariate group by time (1-5 min) effect was significant (F = 10.14, p {\textless} 0.001) with 5 min as the most important time measurement (Wilk's lambda = 0.70, p {\textless} 0.001). The DPB rise for normals was 25.15 +/- 1.31 mmHg (mean +/- SE), range 22.55-27.76 mmHg, with a sensitivity of 78.95{\%} and a specificity of 71.83{\%}. A multivariate analysis of variance showed intraindividual reproducibility of nine normals over four trials (F = 0.950, p {\textgreater} 0.25). Gender and grip strength were additional important variables. In comparison, the tilt table test demonstrated a sensitivity of 82.76{\%} and a specificity of 73.68{\%}. Isometric hand-grip is therefore a specific, sensitive, reproducible, simple and non-invasive test of sympathetic function with relatively well-studied reflex pathways. Its sensitivity and specificity compare favourably with the tilt table test. It should be incorporated in routine autonomic testing.},

abstract = {The cardiac pharmacokinetics of digitalis glycosides is not well understood. In the present study, a mechanism-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was developed to describe the uptake kinetics, receptor interaction, and positive inotropic effect of digoxin in the single-pass isolated perfused rat heart. Three doses of digoxin (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 micromol) were administered to the heart (n = 12) as consecutive 1-min infusions followed by 15-min washout periods. Outflow concentration and left ventricular developed pressure were measured and analyzed by the model. The uptake of digoxin by the heart was limited by capillary permeability with a permeation clearance of 2.35 ml/min/g (about one-third of perfusate flow). Binding kinetics was determined by a mixture of two receptor subtypes, a low-affinity/high-capacity binding site (K(D,1) = 20.9 nmol, 89{\%} of total receptors) and a high-affinity/low-capacity binding site (K(D,2) = 1.5 nmol, 11{\%}). The time course of inotropic response was linked to receptor occupation, with higher efficiency of the high-affinity receptor population. The results suggest that, in the rat heart, consecutive inhibition of first the alpha(2)- and then the alpha(1)-isoform of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase mediates the positive inotropic effect of digoxin with increasing dosage.},

Although the combination of positive inotropic activity with negative chronotropic effects has been shown to reduce hospital admissions in heart failure, there is a distinct lack of robust trial data, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation. We recently performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of all digoxin studies and demonstrated a neutral effect on mortality. This contradicts prior observational data that overlook the fact that digitalis is usually given as second-line therapy to the sickest patients. Use of these agents in clinical practice should take account of appropriate dose, serum concentration, drug interactions, and potential side effects. The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence base for cardiac glycosides and provide a pragmatic guide to their advantages and disadvantages.},

The averaged serum digoxin concentration--time and response--time data were analyzed pharmacokinetically using a three-compartment open model and nonlinear least-squares fitting. When only the serum level--time data were analyzed, a close relationship was found between calculated digoxin levels in the slowly distributing (deep) peripheral compartment and response of the heart to digoxin, as measured by changes in the QS2 index (delta QS2I). Although it was not possible to distinguish clearly a linear from a nonlinear relationship between digoxin levels in the deep compartment and delta QS2I, the nonlinear relationship gave the best overall fit when both serum digoxin and delta QS2I data were fitted simultaneously. The simultaneous fit yielded a total body clearance of digoxin of 3.6 ml/min/kg and a terminal t1/2 of 42 hr.},

It also predicted the effect of renal failure on digoxin pharmacokinetics in the dog. An attempt to scale the dog model to humans by simply considering differences in organ volumes, organ flow rates, and digoxin clearances was partially successful. Good predictions of plasma digoxin concentration and urinary digoxin excretion after a single dose and of steady-state plasma, heart, and skeletal muscle digoxin concentrations were obtained. However, the model predicted considerably higher kidney digoxin concentrations than are actually found. Although the model adequately characterized the time course of digoxin concentrations in patients with moderate renal impairment, it provided a relatively poor fit to that observed in anuric patients.},

Here, we propose and mathematically study a model of the MFL and show that, by itself, it can serve both as a bistable switch and as a clock (an oscillator) depending on kinetic parameters. The MFL phase diagram as well as a detailed description of the nonlinear oscillation regime are presented and some biological examples are discussed.

abstract = {Glucose tolerance is determined by both insulin action and insulin-independent effects, or "glucose effectiveness," which includes glucose-mediated stimulation of glucose uptake (Rd) and suppression of hepatic glucose output (HGO). Despite its importance to tolerance, controversy surrounds accurate assessment of glucose effectiveness. Furthermore, the relative contributions of glucose's actions on Rd and HGO under steady state and dynamic conditions are unclear. We performed hyperglycemic clamps and intravenous glucose tolerance tests in eight normal dogs, and assessed glucose effectiveness by two independent methods. During clamps, glucose was raised to three successive 90-min hyperglycemic plateaus by variable labeled glucose infusion rate; glucose effectiveness (GE) was quantified as the slope of the dose-response relationship between steady state glucose and glucose infusion rate (GE[CLAMP(total)]), Rd (GE[CLAMP(uptake)]) or HGO (GE[CLAMP(HGO)]). During intravenous glucose tolerance tests, tritiated glucose (1.2 microCi/kg) was injected with cold glucose (0.3 g/kg); glucose and tracer dynamics were analyzed using a two-compartment model of glucose kinetics to obtain Rd and HGO components of glucose effectiveness. All experiments were performed during somatostatin inhibition of islet secretion, and basal insulin and glucagon replacement. During clamps, Rd rose from basal (2.54+/-0.20) to 3.95+/-0.54, 6.76+/-1.21, and 9.48+/-1.27 mg/min per kg during stepwise hyperglycemia; conversely, HGO declined to 2.06+/-0.17, 1.17+/-0.19, and 0.52+/-0.33 mg/min per kg. Clamp-based glucose effectiveness was 0.0451+/-0.0061, 0.0337+/-0.0060, and 0.0102+/-0.0009 dl/min per kg for GE[CLAMP(total)], GE[CLAMP(uptake)], and GE[CLAMP(HGO)], respectively. Glucose's action on Rd dominated overall glucose effectiveness (72.2+/-3.3{\%} of total), a result virtually identical to that obtained during intravenous glucose tolerance tests (71.6+/-6.1{\%} of total). Both methods yielded similar estimates of glucose effectiveness. These results provide strong support that glucose effectiveness can be reliably estimated, and that glucose-stimulated Rd is the dominant component during both steady state and dynamic conditions.},

abstract = {This study compared classical and model-based beta-cell responses during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a meal tolerance test (MTT) in a population-based cohort. Individuals with normal glucose metabolism (NGM, n = 161), impaired glucose metabolism (IGM, n = 19) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM, n = 20) underwent a 75g-OGTT and an MTT (75 g carbohydrates, 50 g fat, 24 g proteins). Classical estimates of beta-cell function (insulinogenic index and the ratio of areas under insulin and glucose curves) were calculated. Mathematical modelling was used to determine beta-cell glucose sensitivity, rate sensitivity and potentiation. Insulin sensitivity was characterized by three surrogate estimates. Both classical and model-based estimates of beta-cell function were higher during MTT than during OGTT (P {\textless} 0.05). Regarding the model-based parameters, especially beta-cell sensitivity was increased following MTT as compared with OGTT (P {\textless} 0.05). Both during OGTT and MTT, across most parameters describing beta-cell function, the largest reduction in beta-cell response occurred between IGM and DM, while the largest reduction in insulin sensitivity occurred between NGM and IGM. We conclude that beta-cell response is stronger after a mixed meal than after an OGTT with equal carbohydrate quantity, both for classical and model-based parameters. The higher response was mostly explained by higher beta-cell sensitivity during the meal. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is unknown how the interdigestive migrating motor complex influences the gastric emptying of liquids. Therefore, the gastric emptying rate of 50- and 200-mL volumes of phenol red solution were measured while monitoring contractile activity. Motor activity was recorded using a hydraulic manometric system and expressed as either the proximity of dosing time to time of appearance of phase III or as a motility index, defined as (contractile area)/(sampling interval time). After an initial lag period, emptying was log linear. With a 50-mL oral dose, the mean gastric emptying rate of the log-linear phase was successively faster during phase I (0.018 ± 0.003 min-1), phase II (0.083 ± 0.031 min-1), and late phase II/III (0.171 ± 0.066 min-1) (P {\textless} 0.05). Similarly, the mean lag time decreased successively with phases I, II, and late II/III (19.1 ± 12.4, 7.6 ± 5.6, and 3.8 ± 2.8 minutes, respectively). At a 200-mL oral dose, there was no difference in the emptying rate between phase I and phase II (0.104 ± 0.0014 vs. 0.110 ± 0.041 min-1), but the emptying rate during late phase II/III was significantly greater (0.236 ± 0.069 min-1); lag time was not dependent on phase. There was a statistical difference in the overall mean emptying rate between the 50- and 200-mL volumes. Also, during phase I, the emptying rate was faster for the 200-mL volume. This study shows a strong dependence of liquid gastric emptying rate and lag time on interdigestive antral motility, the emptying of small volumes being more dependent on motility phase than that of large volumes. Phase-related fluctuations in contractile activity can account for much of the reported variability in gastric emptying data. Furthermore, this study suggests that dose volume and interdigestive motor activity at the time of drug administration can affect absorption and onset of therapeutic response for some drugs. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {The influence of various fasting-state gastrointestinal parameters on variability in absorption of cimetidine was studied using simulation and cimetidine administration as a duodenal infusion and as an oral tablet in fistulated mongrel dogs. In the simulation studies, the frequency of double-peak occurrence in plasma profiles was estimated employing average gastric emptying rates as well as interdigestive- migrating-motor-complex (IMMC) phase lengths that were systematically altered. Emptying rates and phase lengths were modeled as periodic step functions. Simulations indicated that double peaks occur when gastric emptying of the drug begins in early phase I or late phase II/III, which represent the periods of very low, medium, and high gastrointestinal motility, respectively. The incidence is increased for longer phase-I duration and higher elimination rate constants. For a compound with a 2 h elimination or disposition half-life, two concentration maxima (double peaks) were found in 12{\{}{\%}{\}} of the simulated concentration-time profiles. The double peak frequency in simulated curves was considerably higher for t(1/2) {\{}{\textless}{\}} 30 min. When cimetidine was administered to dogs as a duodenal infusion in the active and quiescent motility phases, discontinuous profiles were observed, although the variability of the various parameters was reduced when compared. Pharmacokinetic models were set up that were characterized by multi-segmental input (one- to 3-lag-time models were used) for the profiles resulting from oral and duodenal administration. The lag time for the first process characterized the onset of absorption. A significant difference between phases was detected for infusions at pH 8, where the initial lag time was longer in the quiescent phase. The mean input time (MIT) was calculated as the integral input parameter. There was a tendency for the MIT to be higher for pH 6 infusions than for pH 4 and pH 8. Bioavailability analysis indicated that cimetidine was more rapidly and completely absorbed at pH 8 than at pH 6. Bioavailability was also slightly higher at pH 4 than at pH 6. We concluded that gastric emptying increased the variability of the cimetidine concentration-against- time profiles and that it plays a role with respect to double-peak occurrence, although it is only one of several causative factors.

A nested random effects analysis of variance showed moderate intrasubject variability for solid emptying and high intrasubject variability for liquid emptying. The variability of solid and liquid emptying was comparable and relatively large when compared with other reports in the literature. The isotopic method for measuring gastric emptying is a valuable tool for investigating problems in gastric pathophysiology, particularly when differences between groups of subjects are sought. However, meal emptying time is a variable phenomenon in healthy subjects with significant inter- and intraindividual day-to-day differences.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a mathematical model that would adequately describe human gastric emptying of pellets under fasting conditions of healthy subjects. METHODS: Scintigraphic profiles representing the gastric emptying of pellets were obtained from the literature. Altogether 19 individual and three mean scintigraphic profiles were collected. Three mathematical models namely; the lag-time exponential (two parameters), the Weibull (two parameters), and the double Weibull (five parameters) model were proposed and fitted to the gastric emptying profiles. RESULTS: Different patterns of gastric emptying (immediate and rapid, delayed but rapid, delayed and slow, and interruptive emptying) were observed, with the emptying time varied from approximately 15 min to more than 3 h. The best model for fitting to the individual profiles was the double Weibull model. This model also provided an insight into the mechanism of interruptive emptying of pellets, observed for some patients. In addition, mean gastric emptying of pellets was calculated using the Weibull model. CONCLUSIONS: Mean gastric emptying of pellets was adequately described by the Weibull model (eta = 61.9 min, beta = 0.895), which could be applied in the design of in vitro dissolution experiments for pellet formulations with pH dependent dissolution.},

abstract = {To support decision-making around diet selection choices to manage glycemia following a meal, a novel mechanistic model of intermittent gastric emptying and plasma glucose-insulin dynamics was developed. Model development was guided by postprandial timecourses of plasma glucose, insulin and the gastric emptying marker acetaminophen in infant calves fed meals of 2 or 4 L milk replacer. Assigning a fast, slow or zero first-order gastric emptying rate to each interval between plasma samples fit acetaminophen curves with prediction errors equal to 9{\%} of the mean observed acetaminophen concentration. Those gastric emptying parameters were applied to glucose appearance in conjunction with minimal models of glucose disposal and insulin dynamics to describe postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. The final model contains 20 parameters, 8 of which can be obtained by direct measurement and 12 by fitting to observations. The minimal model of intestinal glucose delivery contains 2 gastric emptying parameters and a third parameter describing the time lag between emptying and appearance of glucose in plasma. Sensitivity analysis of the aggregate model revealed that gastric emptying rate influences area under the plasma insulin curve but has little effect on area under the plasma glucose curve. This result indicates that pancreatic responsiveness is influenced by gastric emptying rate as a consequence of the quasi-exponential relationship between plasma glucose concentration and pancreatic insulin release. The fitted aggregate model was able to reproduce the multiple postprandial rises and falls in plasma glucose concentration observed in calves consuming a normal-sized meal containing milk components.},

abstract = {Fructose consumption by Americans has increased markedly, whereas Ca(2+) intake has decreased below recommended levels. Because fructose metabolism decreases enterocyte ATP concentrations, we tested the hypothesis that luminal fructose acutely reduces active, diet-inducible Ca(2+) transport in the small intestine. We confirmed that the decrease in ATP concentrations was indeed greater in fructose- compared with glucose-incubated mucosal homogenates from wild-type and was prevented in fructose-incubated homogenates from ketohexokinase (KHK)(-/-) mice. We then induced active Ca(2+) transport by chronically feeding wild-type, fructose transporter glucose transporter 5 (GLUT5)(-/-), as well as KHK(-/-) mice a low Ca(2+) diet and measured transepithelial Ca(2+) transport in everted duodenal sacs incubated in solutions containing glucose, fructose, or their nonmetabolizable analogs. The diet-induced increase in active Ca(2+) transport was proportional to dramatic increases in expression of the Ca(2+)-selective channel transient receptor potential vanilloid family calcium channel 6 as well as of the Ca(2+)-binding protein 9k (CaBP9k) but not that of the voltage-dependent L-type channel Ca(v)1.3. Crypt-villus distribution of CaBP9k seems heterogeneous, but low Ca(2+) diets induce expression in more cells. In contrast, KHK distribution is homogeneous, suggesting that fructose metabolism can occur in all enterocytes. Diet-induced Ca(2+) transport was not enhanced by addition of the enterocyte fuel glutamine and was always greater in sacs of wild-type, GLUT5(-/-), and KHK(-/-) mice incubated with fructose or nonmetabolizable sugars than those incubated with glucose. Thus duodenal Ca(2+) transport is not affected by fructose and enterocyte ATP concentrations but instead may decrease with glucose metabolism, as Ca(2+) transport remains high with 3-O-methylglucose that is also transported by sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 but cannot be metabolized.},

abstract = {1. Motility of the stomach Anatomic regions of the stomach are the fundus, corpus (body), antrum and pylorus. The functional regions of the stomach do not correspond to the anatomic regions. Functionally, the stomach can be divided into the gastric reservoir and the gastric pump (Fig. 1). The gastric reservoir consists of the fundus and corpus. The gastric pump is represented by the area at which peristaltic waves occur: it includes the distal part of the corpus and the antrum. Due to different properties of the smooth muscle cells the gastric reservoir is characterised by tonic activity and the gastric pump by phasic activity. 1.1 Function of the gastric reservoir At the beginning of the 20 th century it was already observed that with increasing volume of the stomach the internal pressure of the stomach increases only slightly. In dogs, for instance, the increase in pressure is only 1.2 cm of water/100 ml volume. The small increase in gastric pressure indicates that the stomach does not behave like an elastic balloon but that it relaxes as it fills. Three kinds of gastric relaxation can be differentiated: a receptive, an adaptive and a feedback-relaxation of the gastric reservoir. The receptive relaxation consists of a brief relaxation during chewing and swallowing. The stimulation of mechano-receptors in the mouth and pharynx induces vago-vagal reflexes which cause a relaxation of the gastric reservoir (Fig. 2). By this receptive relaxation the stomach is prepared to receive a bolus of food. When the stomach is filled with digesta, mechano-and/or chemoreceptors are stimulated which elicit gastro-gastric reflexes and thus an adaptive relaxation (Fig. 2). This regulation provides a prolonged storage of the digesta until they are sufficiently broken down for emptying into the duodenum. Among others Gastrin, which stimulates the secretion of gastric juice, causes an additional relaxation of the gastric reservoir. This hormonal control stimulates an increased volume in the stomach for the secreted gastric juice without increase in intraluminal pressure. A further reflex regulation of the gastric reservoir is induced by nutrients of the small intestine (Fig. 2). This feedback-relaxation of the stomach and the associated prolonged storage of digesta are a precondition that gastric emptying is adapted to the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. Because both the gastric reservoir and the gastric pump are involved in the feedback regulation, this control mechanism is described in detail in chapter 1.4. Fundus},

abstract = {Intraindividual variation in the results of repeated oral glucose tolerance tests in normal subjects is well recognized but incompletely explained. The present studies show that such variation can be produced by ingestion of the glucose solution during different phases of the normal fasting activity cycle of the upper gut. Such variation is not seen when glucose is administered intraduodenally during the same phases of activity. Gastric emptying shows similar variation with the activity cycle; larger volumes of solution were emptied from the stomach during activity than quiescence, thus presenting greater quantities of glucose solution to the small intestine for absorption. Metoclopramide and hyoscine butylbromide, drugs known to influence the rate of gastric emptying, reduced the variation in the glucose tolerance test. The data suggest a possible use of the glucose tolerance test for the assessment of gastric emptying. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {The majority of studies relating to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) have not taken gastric emptying (GE), which exhibits a substantial inter-individual variation, into account. We sought to evaluate the impact of GE, on the glycemic and insulinemic responses to a 75-g oral glucose load in older subjects with normal and impaired glucose tolerance. Eighty-seven healthy 'older' subjects (47F, 40M; age 71.0 ± 0.5 year) were given a drink comprising of 75-g glucose and 150 mg C(13)-acetate made up to 300 mL with water on a single occasion. Exhaled breath was obtained for analysis of (13)CO2 and calculation of the 50{\%} GE time (T50). Blood glucose, serum insulin and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) were measured, and the insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and the disposition index (DI), were calculated. Thirty-one subjects had normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 46 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Blood glucose at t = 60 min and t = 120 min were related inversely to ISI (P {\textless} 0.001) and DI P {\textless} 0.001). The rise in blood glucose at t = 60 min was related inversely to the T50 in all subjects (P {\textless} 0.01), and those with IGT (P {\textless} 0.001), but not NGT. There were no significant relationships between the blood glucose at t = 120 min with the T50, but in both groups the change in blood glucose from baseline at t = 180 min was related (NGT: P {\textless} 0.001; IGT: P {\textless} 0.001) to the T50. We conclude that in NGT and IGT, the effect of GE on both the 'early' and 'late' glycemic responses to a 75-g oral glucose load is complementary to that of insulin sensitivity.},

abstract = {Eight healthy male volunteers ingested an aqueous solution containing acetaminophen (20 mg/kg) and a nonabsorbable isotopic marker. The concentrations of unconjugated acetaminophen in samples of blood plasma taken at frequent intervals were measured by gas-liquid chromatography. The data points followed a smooth curve in most cases and were fitted to the classical two-compartment pharmacokinetic model to obtain KA, the apparent first-order rate constant for absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric emptying was measured simultaneously from serial scintiscans of the subject's abdomen. The subjects were also studied after intramuscular injection of meperidine (150 mg) and pentazocine (60 mg) with and without naloxone (1.2 mg). The acetaminophen absorption curves and gastric emptying patterns were consistent with negligible absorption from the stomach. A new model is proposed in which the conventional single compartment used to represent the gastrointestinal tract is replaced by two compartments: one represents the stomach and the other the small intestine, from which absorption occurs rapidly. Pharmacokinetic analysis using this model showed good agreement in all cases, and provided an estimate of KA, the first-order rate constant for drug transfer from the intestinal lumen into the systemic circulation. The mean half-time for transfer was 6.8 +/- 0.9 min. As expected, KA was greater than KG (the first-order rate constant for gastric emptying), showing that gastric emptying was rate-limiting in the absorption of acetaminophen. The value of KA was greater than KA and the two were not related. The value of KA was not equal to KG in most studies because gastric emptying was not a single exponential process.},

@article{Oberle1987,
abstract = {A physiological flow model is presented to account for plasma level double peaks based on cyclical gastric emptying and intestinal motility in the fasted state. Central to the model is the assumption that gastric emptying and intestinal transit rates will vary directly with the strength of the contractile activity characteristic of the fasted state motility cycle. Simulated curves clearly indicate that variable gastric emptying rates can result in variable absorption rates from the gastrointestinal tract and double peaks in the plasma level curves of cimetidine. Vital to the occurrence of double peaks are (i) dosing time relative to phasic activity, (ii) variability in flow out of the stomach, and (iii) a small emptying rate constant Qs/Vs, for a period of time within the first hour after administration. Variability in intestinal flow rates alone does not cause a double peak in the plasma level curve. Results of the simulations, as well as experimental results, can be categorized according to the shapes of the plasma level curves into four types: type A, Cpmax (1) less than Cpmax (2); type B, single peak; type C, Cpmax (1) greater than Cpmax (2); type D, Cpmax(1) = Cpmax(2). Assuming that the experimental results were obtained from fasted subjects, with the time of dose administration being a random variable, the frequency of the experimental curves having shape A, B, C, or D correlates extremely well with theoretical predictions. It is concluded that variable gastric emptying rates due to the motility cycle can account for plasma level double peaks. Furthermore, variable gastric emptying rates combined with the short plasma elimination half-life and poor gastric absorption of cimetidine can be the cause of the frequently observed plasma level double peaks.},

abstract = {The plasma concentration-time profiles following oral administration of drugs are often irregular and cannot be interpreted easily with conventional models based on first- or zero-order absorption kinetics and lag time. Six new models were developed using a time-dependent absorption rate coefficient, ka(t), wherein the time dependency was varied to account for the dynamic processes such as changes in fluid absorption or secretion, in absorption surface area, and in motility with time, in the gastrointestinal tract. In the present study, the plasma concentration profiles of propranolol obtained in human subjects following oral dosing were analyzed using the newly derived models based on mass balance and compared with the conventional models. Nonlinear regression analysis indicated that the conventional compartment model including lag time (CLAG model) could not predict the rapid initial increase in plasma concentration after dosing and the predicted Cmax values were much lower than that observed. On the other hand, all models with the time-dependent absorption rate coefficient, ka(t), were superior to the CLAG model in predicting plasma concentration profiles. Based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), the fluid absorption model without lag time (FA model) exhibited the best overall fit to the data. The two-phase model including lag time, TPLAG model was also found to be a good model judging from the values of sum of squares. This model also described the irregular profiles of plasma concentration with time and frequently predicted Cmax values satisfactorily. A comparison of the absorption rate profiles also suggested that the TPLAG model is better at prediction of irregular absorption kinetics than the FA model. In conclusion, the incorporation of a time-dependent absorption rate coefficient ka(t) allows the prediction of nonlinear absorption characteristics in a more reliable manner.},

We review the oral minimal method (i.e., models that allow the estimation of insulin sensitivity, $\beta$-cell responsivity, and hepatic insulin extraction from a mixed-meal or an oral glucose tolerance test). Both of these oral tests are more physiologic and simpler to administer than those based on an intravenous test (e.g., a glucose clamp or an intravenous glucose tolerance test). The focus of this review is on indices provided by physiological-based models and their validation against the glucose clamp technique. We discuss first the oral minimal model method rationale, data, and protocols. Then we present the three minimal models and the indices they provide. The disposition index paradigm, a widely used $\beta$-cell function metric, is revisited in the context of individual versus population modeling. Adding a glucose tracer to the oral dose significantly enhances the assessment of insulin action by segregating insulin sensitivity into its glucose disposal and hepatic components. The oral minimal model method, by quantitatively portraying the complex relationships between the major players of glucose metabolism, is able to provide novel insights regarding the regulation of postprandial metabolism.},

abstract = {Water is absorbed across the small intestine in the absence of external driving forces. However, it has been established that water transport is secondary to active sodium transport. In the upper intestine both sodium and water absorption are largely dependent on the presence of D-glucose. The link between active sodium transport and glucose is the coupled transport of sodium and glucose across the brush border membrane of enterocytes by the Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1). Na+ that enters the cells with glucose is pumped out towards the blood by 3Na+/2K+ pumps on the basolateral membrane, and glucose passes out across the basolateral membrane by facilitated diffusion, the net result being that glucose and sodium are transported across the epithelium. The coupling between Na+, glucose, and water transport is less well understood. It is commonly thought that Na+ transport increases the local osmotic pressure in the lateral intercellular spaces, and that this in turn generates osmotic water flow across the epithelium. Recent work suggests a more direct link between Na+, glucose, and water transport; that is, water is cotransported along with Na+ and sugar through SGLT1. Here we review the evidence for Na+/glucose/water cotransport.},

abstract = {The rate and extent of drug dissolution and absorption from solid oral dosage forms is highly dependent upon the volumes and distribution of gastric and small intestinal water. However, little is known about the time courses and distribution of water volumes in vivo in an undisturbed gut. Previous imaging studies offered a snapshot of water distribution in fasted humans and showed that water in the small intestine is distributed in small pockets. This study aimed to quantify the volume and number of water pockets in the upper gut of fasted healthy humans following ingestion of a glass of water (240 mL, as recommended for bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies), using recently validated noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. Twelve healthy volunteers underwent upper and lower abdominal MRI scans before drinking 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. After ingesting the water, they were scanned at intervals for 2 h. The drink volume, inclusion criteria, and fasting conditions matched the international standards for BA/BE testing in healthy volunteers. The images were processed for gastric and intestinal total water volumes and for the number and volume of separate intestinal water pockets larger than 0.5 mL. The fasted stomach contained 35 ± 7 mL (mean ± SEM) of resting water. Upon drinking, the gastric fluid rose to 242 ± 9 mL. The gastric water volume declined rapidly after that with a half emptying time (T50{\%}) of 13 ± 1 min. The mean gastric volume returned back to baseline 45 min after the drink. The fasted small bowel contained a total volume of 43 ± 14 mL of resting water. Twelve minutes after ingestion of water, small bowel water content rose to a maximum value of 94 ± 24 mL contained within 15 ± 2 pockets of 6 ± 2 mL each. At 45 min, when the glass of water had emptied completely from the stomach, total intestinal water volume was 77 ± 15 mL distributed into 16 ± 3 pockets of 5 ± 1 mL each. MRI provided unprecedented insights into the time course, number, volume, and location of water pockets in the stomach and small intestine under conditions that represent standard BA/BE studies using validated techniques. These data add to our current understanding of gastrointestinal physiology and will help improve physiological relevance of in vitro testing methods and in silico transport analyses for prediction of bioperformance of oral solid dosage forms, particularly for low solubility Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class 2 and Class 4 compounds.},

abstract = {Spinal cord transection (SCT) delays gastric emptying (GE), and intestinal and gastrointestinal (GI) transit of liquid in awake rats. This study evaluates the neural mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. Male Wistar rats (N = 147) were fasted for 16 h and had the left jugular vein cannulated followed by laminectomy or laminectomy + complete SCT between T4 and T5 vertebrae. The next day, a test meal (1.5 ml of a phenol red solution, 0.5 mg/ml in 5{\%} glucose) was administered by gavage feeding and 10 min later cervical dislocation was performed. Dye recovery in the stomach, and proximal, mid and distal small intestine was determined by spectrophotometry. SCT inhibited GE and GI transit since it increased gastric recovery by 71.3{\%} and decreased mid small intestine recovery by 100{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, celiac ganglionectomy + section of the splanchnic nerves, i.v. hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) or yohimbine (3 mg/kg) prevented the development of the SCT effect on GE and GI transit. Pretreatment with i.v. naloxone (2 mg/kg), L-NAME (3 mg/kg) or propranolol (2 mg/kg) was ineffective. Bilateral adrenalectomy or guanethidine (10 mg/kg) increased the magnitude of the GE inhibition, while i.v. prazosin (1 mg/kg) or atropine (0.5 mg/kg) decreased the magnitude but did not abolish the GE inhibition. In summary, the inhibition of GI motility observed 1 day after thoracic SCT in awake rats seems to involve vagal and possibly splanchnic pathways.},

abstract = {The classical functions of bile acids include acting as detergents to facilitate the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the gut. In addition, bile acids also act as signaling molecules to regulate glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and energy expenditure. The signaling potential of bile acids in compartments such as the systemic circulation is regulated in part by an efficient enterohepatic circulation that functions to conserve and channel the pool of bile acids within the intestinal and hepatobiliary compartments. Changes in hepatobiliary and intestinal bile acid transport can alter the composition, size, and distribution of the bile acid pool. These alterations in turn can have significant effects on bile acid signaling and their downstream metabolic targets. This review discusses recent advances in our understanding of the inter-relationship between the enterohepatic cycling of bile acids and the metabolic consequences of signaling via bile acid-activated receptors, such as farnesoid X nuclear receptor (FXR) and the G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5).},

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels and represents a worldwide health issue. Postprandial hyperglycemia is considered a major predictor of diabetic complications, and its reduction represents a specific treatment target in Type 1 and 2 diabetes. Since postprandial glucose excursions depend to a large extent on gastric secretion and emptying, amylin and glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs are prescribed to reduce them. Although gastric function is considered mainly sensitive to ingested calories, its chemospecificity is not well understood. To identify ingestible nutrients reducing postprandial hyperglycemia, we applied intragastrically more than 40 individual nutrients at an isomolar dose to rats and quantified their impact on gastric secretion and emptying using a novel in vivo computed tomography imaging method. We identified l-tryptophan, l-arginine, l-cysteine, and l-lysine as the most potent modulators with effective strength comparable to a supraphysiological dose of amylin. Importantly, all identified candidates reduced postprandial glucose excursion within an oral glucose tolerance test in healthy and diabetic rats. This clinical beneficial effect originated predominantly from their impact on gastric function, as none of the candidates altered plasma glucose concentrations induced by intraperitoneal or intraduodenal glucose tolerance tests. Overall, these data demonstrate a remarkable chemospecificity of stomach function, unveil a strong role of the stomach for glycemic control and identifies nutrients with antidiabetic potential.},

abstract = {Feeding intolerance is a common issue in the care of preterm neonates. The condition manifests as delayed emptying of gastric contents and represents a therapeutic challenge, since the factors accounting for its manifestations are unknown. The main goal of this study was to comparatively investigate the age-related function of rat gastric and pyloric smooth muscle and their putative regulators. We hypothesized that a reduced gastric muscle contraction potential early in life contributes to the delayed gastric emptying of the newborn. Newborn and adult rat gastric (fundus) and pyloric sphincter tissues were comparatively studied in vitro. Shortening of the tissue-specific dissociated smooth muscle cell was evaluated, and expression of the key regulatory proteins Rho-associated kinase 2 and myosin light chain kinase was determined. Gastric and pyloric smooth muscle cell shortening was significantly greater in the adult than the respective newborn counterpart. Expression of myosin light chain kinase and Rho-associated kinase 2 was developmentally regulated and increased with age. Pyloric sphincter muscle expresses a higher neuronal nitric oxide synthase and phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein content in newborn than adult tissue. Compared with later in life, the newborn rat gastropyloric muscle has a Ca(2+)-related reduced potential for contraction and the pyloric sphincter relaxation-dependent modulators are overexpressed. To the extent that these rodent data can be extrapolated to humans, the delayed gastric emptying in the newborn reflects reduced stomach muscle contraction potential, as opposed to increased pyloric sphincter tone.},

Gastric emptying exhibits a large interindividual variation; the latter not only accounts for differences in postprandial glycemia but also determines postprandial incretin profiles. Accordingly, the rate of gastric emptying may affect the glucose-lowering efficacy of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. In contrast, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists lower postprandial glycemia predominantly by their action to slow gastric emptying. This review discusses the inter-relationship between gastric emptying and the incretin axis in the context of changes in blood glucose, with an emphasis on the relevant clinical implications.},

abstract = {Absorption models used in the estimation of pharmacokinetic drug characteristics from plasma concentration data are generally empirical and simple, utilizing no prior information on gastro-intestinal (GI) transit patterns. Our aim was to develop and evaluate an estimation strategy based on a mechanism-based model for drug absorption, which takes into account the tablet movement through the GI transit. This work is an extension of a previous model utilizing tablet movement characteristics derived from magnetic marker monitoring (MMM) and pharmacokinetic data. The new approach, which replaces MMM data with a GI transit model, was evaluated in data sets where MMM data were available (felodipine) or not available (diclofenac). Pharmacokinetic profiles in both datasets were well described by the model according to goodness-of-fit plots. Visual predictive checks showed the model to give superior simulation properties compared with a standard empirical approach (first-order absorption rate + lag-time). This model represents a step towards an integrated mechanism-based NLME model, where the use of physiological knowledge and in vitro–in vivo correlation helps fully characterize PK and generate hypotheses for new formulations or specific populations.},

abstract = {Glucose is the major energy source for mammalian cells as well as an important substrate for protein and lipid synthesis. Mammalian cells take up glucose from extracellular fluid into the cell through two families of structurallyrelated glucose transporters. The facilitative glucose transporter family (solute carriers SLC2A, protein symbol GLUT) mediates a bidirectional and energy-independent process of glucose transport in most tissues and cells, while the NaM(+)/glucose cotransporter family (solute carriers SLC5A, protein symbol SGLT) mediates an active, Na(+)-linked transport process against an electrochemical gradient. The GLUT family consists of thirteen members (GLUT1-12 and HMIT). Phylogenetically, the members of the GLUT family are split into three classes based on protein similarities. Up to now, at least six members of the SGLT family have been cloned (SGLT1-6). In this review, we report both the genomic structure and function of each transporter as well as intra-species comparative genomic analysis of some of these transporters. The affinity for glucose and transport kinetics of each transporter differs and ranges from 0.2 to 17mM. The ability of each protein to transport alternative substrates also differs and includes substrates such as fructose and galactose. In addition, the tissue distribution pattern varies between species. There are different regulation mechanisms of these transporters. Characterization of transcriptional control of some of the gene promoters has been investigated and alternative promoter usage to generate different protein isoforms has been demonstrated. We also introduce some pathophysiological roles of these transporters in human.},

abstract = {Glucose enters eucaryotic cells via 2 different types of membrane associated carrier proteins, the Na+-coupled glucose transporters (SGLT) and glucose transporter facilitators (GLUT). Three members of the SGLT family function as sugar transporters (SGLT1 and SGLT2) or sensors (SGLT3). The human GLUT family consists of 14 members, of which 11 have been shown to catalyze sugar transport. The individual isotypes exhibit different substrate specificity, kinetic characteristics, and expression profiles, thereby allowing a tissue-specific adaptation of glucose uptake through regulation of their gene expression. Furthermore, some transporters (eg, GLUT4 and GLUT8) are regulated by their subcellular distribution. In addition to catalyzing glucose entry into cells, some isotypes (eg, GLUT2) seem to be involved in the mechanisms of glucosensing of pancreatic beta-cells, neuronal, or other cells, thereby playing a major role in the hormonal and neural control. Targeted disruption in mice has helped to elucidate the physiologic function of some isotypes (GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT4). Furthermore, several congenital defects of sugar metabolism are caused by aberrant transporter genes (eg, the glucose-galactose malabsorption syndrome, SGLT1; the glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome; and the Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, GLUT2). In addition, a malfunction of glucose transporter expression or regulation (GLUT4) appears to contribute to the insulin resistance syndrome.},

Although a basic knowledge of the hexose transporters has already been gained, their detailed distribution and comparative intensities of expression throughout the gastrointestinal tract have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the expression of SGLT1, GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT5 by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR techniques using a total of 28 segments from the gastrointestinal tract of 9-week-old mice. GLUT2 and GLUT5 mRNA expressions were detected predominantly from the proximal to middle parts of the small intestine, showing identical expression profiles, while SGLT1 mRNA was expressed not only in the small intestine but also in the large intestine. Notably, GLUT1 mRNA was expressed at a considerable level in both the stomach and large intestine but was negligible in the small intestine. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the polarized localization of hexose transporters in the large intestine: SGLT1 on the luminal surface and GLUT1 on the basal side of epithelial cells. The present study provided more elaborate information concerning the localization of hexose transporters in the small intestine. Furthermore, this study revealed the significant expression of glucose transporters in the large intestine, suggesting the existence of the physiological uptake of glucose in that location in mice.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Glycemic control is important in diabetes mellitus to minimize the progression of the disease and the risk of potentially devastating complications. Inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2 induces glucosuria and has been established as a new anti-hyperglycemic strategy. SGLT1 plays a distinct and complementing role to SGLT2 in glucose homeostasis and, therefore, SGLT1 inhibition may also have therapeutic potential. Areas covered: This review focuses on the physiology of SGLT1 in the small intestine and kidney and its pathophysiological role in diabetes. The therapeutic potential of SGLT1 inhibition, alone as well as in combination with SGLT2 inhibition, for anti-hyperglycemic therapy are discussed. Additionally, this review considers the effects on other SGLT1-expressing organs like the heart. Expert opinion: SGLT1 inhibition improves glucose homeostasis by reducing dietary glucose absorption in the intestine and by increasing the release of gastrointestinal incretins like glucagon-like peptide-1. SGLT1 inhibition has a small glucosuric effect in the normal kidney and this effect is increased in diabetes and during inhibition of SGLT2, which deliver more glucose to SGLT1 in late proximal tubule. In short-term studies, inhibition of SGLT1 and combined SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition appeared to be safe. More data is needed on long-term safety and cardiovascular consequences of SGLT1 inhibition.},

The main question we are aiming to address is the relative effect of gastric empting time and luminal viscosity on the rate of glucose absorption. The results indicate that all factors have a significant effect on the amount of glucose absorbed. For low luminal viscosities (e.g. lower than 0.1 Pas) the rate of absorption is controlled by the gastric emptying time. For viscosities higher than 0.1 Pas a 10 fold increase in viscosity can result in a 4 fold decrease of glucose absorbed. Our model, with the simplifications used to develop it, indicate that for high viscosity luminal phases, gastric emptying rate is not the controlling mechanism for nutrient availability. Developing a mechanistic model could help elucidate the rate limiting steps that control the digestion process.},

abstract = {Nonlinear random effects models with finite mixture structures are used to identify polymorphism in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) phenotypes. An EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation approach is developed and uses sampling-based methods to implement the expectation step, that results in an analytically tractable maximization step. A benefit of the approach is that no model linearization is performed and the estimation precision can be arbitrarily controlled by the sampling process. A detailed simulation study illustrates the feasibility of the estimation approach and evaluates its performance. Applications of the proposed nonlinear random effects mixture model approach to other population PK/PD problems will be of interest for future investigation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) relaxes the stomach during fasting but decreases hunger and food consumption and retards gastric emptying. The interrelationships between volume, emptying, and postprandial symptoms in response to GLP-1 are unclear. We performed, in healthy human volunteers, a placebo-controlled study of the effects of intravenous GLP-1 on gastric volume using (99m)Tc-single photon emission computed tomography imaging, gastric emptying of a nutrient liquid meal (Ensure) using scintigraphy, maximum tolerated volume (MTV) of Ensure, and postprandial symptoms 30 min after MTV. The role of vagal cholinergic function in the effects of GLP-1 was assessed by human pancreatic polypeptide (HPP) response to the Ensure meal. GLP-1 increased fasting and postprandial gastric volumes and retarded gastric emptying; MTV and postprandial symptoms were not different compared with controls. Effects on postprandial gastric function were associated with reduced postprandial HPP levels. GLP-1 does not induce postprandial symptoms despite significant inhibition of gastric emptying and vagal function; this may be partly explained by the increase in postprandial gastric volume.},

abstract = {The inhibitory effect of anti-obesity drugs on energy intake (EI) is counter-acted by feedback regulation of the appetite control circuit leading to drug tolerance. This complicates the design and interpretation of EI studies in rodents that are used for anti-obesity drug development. Here, we investigated a synthetic long-acting analogue of the appetite-suppressing peptide hormone amylin (LAMY) in lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. EI and body weight (BW) were measured daily and LAMY concentrations in plasma were assessed using defined time points following subcutaneous administration of the LAMY at different dosing regimens. Overall, 6 pharmacodynamic (PD) studies including a total of 173 rats were considered in this evaluation. Treatment caused a dose-dependent reduction in EI and BW, although multiple dosing indicated the development of tolerance over time. This behavior could be adequately described by a population model including homeostatic feedback of EI and a turnover model describing the relationship between EI and BW. The model was evaluated by testing its ability to predict BW loss in a toxicology study and was utilized to improve the understanding of dosing regimens for obesity therapy. As such, the model proved to be a valuable tool for the design and interpretation of rodent studies used in anti-obesity drug development.},

abstract = {No research has compared expressions of weight bias across different subgroups of obese individuals. This study compared attitudes toward and beliefs about obesity in women with and without binge eating disorder (BED) and examined whether these attitudes are related to psychological factors. Fifty obese women with BED were compared with an age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched group of 50 obese women without BED on a battery of established measures of anti-fat attitudes and beliefs about weight controllability and psychological factors (self-esteem, depression, and eating disorder features). The ageand BMI-matched groups did not differ with respect to beliefs about obesity or attitudes toward obese persons, or in self-esteem or depression. Correlational analyses conducted separately within each group revealed that women with BED who reported more favorable attitudes towards obese persons had higher self-esteem and lower levels of depression, whereas there were no significant associations between these variables among women without BED. In addition, weight controllability beliefs and eating disorder features were unrelated to self-esteem and depression in both groups. These findings suggest that stigmatizing attitudes endorsed by obese persons are neither tempered nor worsened by psychological distress or eating pathology. Given that stigmatizing attitudes did not differ between obese women with and without BED, it may be that obesity itself, rather than psychological features or disordered eating, increases vulnerability to negative weight-based attitudes. Potential implications for stigma reduction efforts and clinical practice are discussed.},

abstract = {Expansion of intra-abdominal adipose tissue and the accompanying inflammatory response has been put forward as a unifying link between obesity and the development of chronic diseases. However, an apparent sexual dimorphism exists between obesity and chronic disease risk due to differences in the distribution and abundance of adipose tissue. A range of experimental protocols have been employed to demonstrate the role of estrogen in regulating health benefits; however, most studies are confounded by significant differences in body weight and adiposity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare weight-matched obese male and female mice to determine if the sex-dependent health benefits remain when body weight is similar. The development of obesity in female mice receiving a high-fat diet was delayed; however, subsequent comparisons of weight-matched obese mice revealed greater adiposity in obese female mice. Despite excess adiposity and enlarged adipocyte size, obese females remained more glucose tolerant than weight-matched male mice, and this benefit was associated with increased expression of adiponectin and reductions in immune cell infiltration and oxidative stress in adipose tissue. Therefore, the protective benefits of estrogen persist in the obese state and appear to improve the metabolic phenotype of adipose tissue and the individual.},

abstract = {Hypertension in children is frequently undiagnosed. Normal blood pressure is currently defined as a function of two continuous variables, age and height for each gender. Applying the current cutoff values to assess a child's blood pressure is time consuming. To separate the independent effect of age from that of height on blood pressure, we conducted a multiple group matched study to investigate if blood pressure levels in children with a given height distribution vary with age. An equal number of 2539 Chinese children from each of the four age groups (7, 8, 9 and 10 years) were individually matched by height, sex and geographic region. We used the matching technique to force the four age groups to have an identical height distribution. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures significantly increased with increasing age before matching. After matching, four groups had strikingly similar levels of blood pressures, and the differences among four groups were small and not statistically significant. Once height is taken into consideration, age has little impact on blood pressure. Our findings, if confirmed in children of other ages, suggest that blood pressure percentile charts can be considerably simplified by establishing normal percentiles according to height alone for each gender.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to examine whether sex differences in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2 h post-OGTT plasma glucose (2hPG) and HbA(1c) could be explained by differences in body size and/or body composition between men and women in a general non-diabetic Danish population. Moreover, we aimed to study to what degree the newly suggested high-risk HbA(1c) criteria overlapped with the current OGTT-based criteria of glucose intolerance. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from 6,006 non-diabetic men and women. HbA(1c) and FPG levels were measured and a 75 g OGTT was performed in all individuals. Height, weight and waist and hip circumferences were measured and BMI was calculated. Data were analysed in age-adjusted linear regression models. RESULTS: Men had higher FPG and HbA(1c) levels than women, and women had higher 2hPG levels than men. Sex differences in 2hPG levels were explained by differences in height and FPG levels, but sex differences in FPG or HbA(1c) levels were not explained by anthropometric measures. Among individuals with HbA(1c) in the high-risk range (6.0-6.5{\%}), 73{\%} had normal glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Sex differences in 2hPG levels after an OGTT may to some extent be a consequence of giving the same amount of glucose to individuals with different body size. In contrast, sex differences in FPG and HbA(1c) levels are likely to have a true physiological basis. In clinical practice, the HbA(1c) assay may be more convenient than the OGTT, but it is important to note that different populations are identified by the two methods.},

abstract = {Glucose tolerance after meal ingestion in vivo is the result of multiple processes that occur in parallel. Insulin secretion together with reciprocal inhibition of glucagon secretion contributes to glucose tolerance. However, other factors beyond glucose effectiveness and insulin action require consideration. The absorption of ingested nutrients and their subsequent systemic rate of appearance largely depend on the rate of delivery of nutrients to the proximal small intestine. This is determined by the integrated response of the upper gastrointestinal tract to a meal. While gastric emptying is probably the most significant component, other factors need to be considered. This review will examine all processes that could potentially alter the fraction and rate of appearance of ingested nutrients in the peripheral circulation. Several of these processes may be potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Indeed, there is increased interest in gastrointestinal contributions to nutritional homeostasis, as demonstrated by the advent of antidiabetes therapies that alter gastrointestinal motility, the effect of bariatric surgery on diabetes remission, and the potential of the intestinal microbiome as a modulator of human metabolism. The overall goal of this review is to examine current knowledge of the gastrointestinal contributions to metabolic control.},

abstract = {This study investigated in eight healthy male volunteers (a) the gastric emptying pattern of 50 and 100 grams of glucose; (b) its relation to the phase of interdigestive motility (phase I or II) existing when glucose was ingested; and (c) the interplay between gastric emptying or duodenal perfusion of glucose (1.1 and 2.2 kcal/min; identical total glucose loads as orally given) and release of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36)amide (GLP-1), C-peptide, insulin, and plasma glucose. The phase of interdigestive motility existing at the time of glucose ingestion did not affect gastric emptying or any metabolic parameter. Gastric emptying of glucose displayed a power exponential pattern with a short initial lag period. Duodenal delivery of glucose was not constant but exponentially declined over time. Increasing the glucose load reduced the rate of gastric emptying by 27.5{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05) but increased the fractional duodenal delivery of glucose. Both glucose loads induced a fed motor pattern which was terminated by an antral phase III when approximately 95{\%} of the meal had emptied. Plasma GLP-1 rose from basal levels of approximately 1 pmol/liter of peaks of 3.2 +/- 0.6 pmol/liter with 50 grams of glucose and of 7.2 +/- 1.6 pmol/liter with 100 grams of glucose. These peaks occurred 20 min after glucose intake irrespective of the load. A duodenal delivery of glucose exceeding 1.4 kcal/min was required to maintain GLP-1 release in contrast to ongoing GIP release with negligibly low emptying of glucose. Oral administration of glucose yielded higher GLP-1 and insulin releases but an equal GIP release compared with the isocaloric duodenal perfusion. We conclude that (a) gastric emptying of glucose displays a power exponential pattern with duodenal delivery exponentially declining over time and (b) a threshold rate of gastric emptying of glucose must be exceeded to release GLP-1, whereas GIP release is not controlled by gastric emptying.},

abstract = {AIMS: Postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and the 'incretin effect' have been reported to be deficient in Type 2 diabetes, but most studies have not controlled for variations in the rate of gastric emptying. We evaluated blood glucose, and plasma insulin, GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) responses to intraduodenal glucose in Type 2 diabetes, and compared these with data from healthy controls. METHODS: Eight males with well-controlled Type 2 diabetes, managed by diet alone, were studied on four occasions in single-blind, randomized order. Blood glucose, and plasma insulin, GLP-1, and GIP were measured during 120-min intraduodenal glucose infusions at 1 kcal/min (G1), 2 kcal/min (G2) and 4 kcal/min (G4) or saline control. RESULTS: Type 2 patients had higher basal (P {\textless} 0.0005) and incremental (P {\textless} 0.0005) blood glucose responses to G2 and G4, when compared with healthy controls. In both groups, the stimulation of insulin and GLP-1 by increasing glucose loads was not linear; responses to G1 and G2 were minimal, whereas responses to G4 were much greater (P {\textless} 0.005 for each) (incremental area under the GLP-1 curve 224 ± 65, 756 ± 331 and 2807 ± 473 pmol/l.min, respectively, in Type 2 patients and 373 ± 231, 505 ± 161 and 1742 ± 456 pmol/l.min, respectively, in healthy controls). The GLP-1 responses appeared comparable in the two groups. In both groups there was a load-dependent increase in plasma GIP with no difference between them. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with well-controlled Type 2 diabetes, blood glucose, insulin and GLP-1 responses are critically dependent on the small intestinal glucose load, and GLP-1 responses are not deficient.},

abstract = {Previous observations suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is released into the bloodstream only when dietary carbohydrate enters the duodenum at rates that exceed the absorptive capacity of the proximal small intestine to contact GLP-1 bearing mucosa in more distal bowel. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of modifying the length of small intestine exposed to glucose on plasma concentrations of GLP-1 and also glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), insulin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and ghrelin, and antropyloric pressures. Glucose was infused at 3.5 kcal/min into the duodenum of eight healthy males (age 18-59 yr) over 60 min on the first day into an isolated 60-cm segment of the proximal small intestine ("short-segment infusion"); on the second day, the same amount of glucose was infused with access to the entire small intestine ("long-segment infusion"). Plasma GLP-1 increased and ghrelin decreased (P {\textless} 0.05 for both) during the long-, but not the short-, segment infusion. By contrast, increases in plasma CCK and GIP did not differ between days. The rises in blood glucose and plasma insulin were greater during the long- than during the short-segment infusion (P {\textless} 0.05). During the long- but not the short-segment infusion, antral pressure waves (PWs) were suppressed (P {\textless} 0.05). Isolated pyloric PWs and basal pyloric pressure were stimulated on both days. In conclusion, the release of GLP-1 and ghrelin, but not CCK and GIP, is dependent upon {\textgreater}60 cm of the intestine being exposed to glucose.},

abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract plays a major role in the regulation of postprandial glucose profiles. Gastric emptying is a highly regulated process, which normally ensures a limited and fairly constant delivery of nutrients and glucose to the proximal gut. The subsequent digestion and absorption of nutrients are associated with the release of a set of hormones that feeds back to regulate subsequent gastric emptying and regulates the release of insulin, resulting in downregulation of hepatic glucose production and deposition of glucose in insulin-sensitive tissues. These remarkable mechanisms normally keep postprandial glucose excursions low, regardless of the load of glucose ingested. When the regulation of emptying is perturbed (e.g., pyloroplasty, gastric sleeve or gastric bypass operation), postprandial glycemia may reach high levels, sometimes followed by profound hypoglycemia. This article discusses the underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {The importance of the region, as opposed to the length, of small intestine exposed to glucose in determining the secretion of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) remains unclear. We sought to compare the glycemic, insulinemic and incretin responses to glucose administered to the proximal (12–60 cm beyond the pylorus), or more distal ( {\textgreater} 70 cm beyond the pylorus) small intestine, or both. 10 healthy subjects (9M,1F; aged 70.3 ± 1.4 years) underwent infusion of glucose via a catheter into the proximal (glucose proximally; GP), or distal (glucose distally; GD) small intestine, or both (GPD), on three separate days in a randomised fashion. Blood glucose, serum insulin and plasma GLP-1, GIP and CCK responses were assessed. The iAUC for blood glucose was greater in response to GPD than GP (P {\textless} 0.05), with no difference between GD and GP. GP was associated with minimal GLP-1 response (P = 0.05), but substantial increases in GIP, CCK and insulin (P {\textless} 0.001 for all). GPD and GD both stimulated GLP-1, GIP, CCK and insulin (P {\textless} 0.001 for all). Compared to GP, GPD induced greater GLP-1, GIP and CCK responses (P {\textless} 0.05 for all). Compared with GPD, GD was associated with greater GLP-1 (P {\textless} 0.05), but reduced GIP and CCK (P {\textless} 0.05 for both), responses. We conclude that exposure of glucose to the distal small intestine appears necessary for substantial GLP-1 secretion, while exposure of both the proximal and distal small intestine result in substantial secretion of GIP.},

@article{Rohde2016,
abstract = {Bariatric surgery (e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)) has proven the most effective way of achieving sustainable weight losses and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Studies indicate that the effectiveness of RYGB is mediated by an altered gastrointestinal tract anatomy, which in particular favours release of the gut incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The EndoBarrier gastrointestinal liner or duodenal-jejunal bypass sleeve (DJBS) is an endoscopic deployable minimally invasive and fully reversible technique designed to mimic the bypass component of the RYGB. Not only GLP-1 is released when nutrients enter the gastrointestinal tract. Cholecystokinin (CCK), secreted from duodenal I cells, elicits gallbladder emptying. Traditionally, bile acids are thought of as essential elements for fat absorption. However, growing evidence suggests that bile acids have additional effects in metabolism. Thus, bile acids appear to increase GLP-1 secretion via activation of the TGR5 receptor on the intestinal L cell. Recently FXR receptors were postulated to contribute to GLP-1 secretion too. Furthermore, metformin has been shown to increase circulating GLP-1 levels but although the exact mechanism is not fully elucidated it may involve metformin-induced inhibition of bile acid reuptake from the small intestines. Small-sized studies reported varying degrees of weight loss and, in some, improvement of glucose metabolism. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were to collect existing information on the DJBS in order to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety (study I and II). Furthermore, since the endocrine impact of the DJBS is not fully elucidated, and DJBS is expected to mimic RYGB, we investigated postprandial metabolic changes following 26 weeks of DJBS treatment in ten obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and nine matched patients with T2D (study III). Finally, we studied the single and combined effects of CCK induced gallbladder emptying and single-dose metformin on human GLP-1 secretion in ten healthy subjects (study IV). We hypothesized that metformin-induced GLP-1 secretion - at least partly - would be dependent on gallbladder emptying and the presence of bile acids in the gut. DJBS appears to lead to moderate weight losses in obese subjects compared to diet or lifestyle modifications (study II). DJBS had insignificant and small effects (compared to diet) on glycaemic regulation. Adverse events consisted mainly of mild-to-moderate transient dyspepsia. Nearly 20{\%} (n = 66) of DJBS treated subjects experienced a serious adverse event (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding or device migration), which resulted in early device removals. No deaths or liver abscesses were reported following DJBS treatment. In our own study III we found similar, moderate weight losses as in study II. GLP-1 and PYY concentrations increased in patients with T2D (not NGT subjects) after implantation. DJBS had no or minor effects on postprandial levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GIP, CCK or gastrin. Food intake decreased in parallel with an increased sensation of satiety in obese NGT subjects, but were transient. Dyspeptic episodes occurred in nearly all participants. Five devices (21{\%}) were explanted early due to abdominal pain, and few changes of on-going antidiabetic medication were made. Finally, study IV showed that both CCK-induced gallbladder emptying and metformin alone elicited significant GLP-1 responses that were additive upon combination. Moreover, we saw significant PYY and short-lasting glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) responses following gallbladder emptying. In conclusion, in spite of increased GLP-1 responses in patients with T2D and a modest weight loss, DJBS had no effect on postprandial glucose metabolism, and therefore no patient with T2D achieved disease remission. Based on our results, we cannot recommend DJBS to be implemented as a standard of medical care management of obese patients with T2D. Future larger trials may lead to different conclusions. In addition, the observed gut hormone responses following CCK-induced gallbladder emptying and metformin, make suggest that bile acid release into the small intestines with subsequent TGR5 and FXR involvement contributes to stimulation of GLP-1 secretion and, therefore, that metformin's mode of action encompasses both bile acid-dependent and independent stimulation of gut hormone secretion.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of body position on gastric emptying and motor function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve volunteers were investigated in seated position (SP) and upside-down position (UDP) after ingestion of 300 ml water. Magnetic resonance imaging provided a non-invasive assessment of gastric emptying and volumes, intragastric distribution and peristaltic function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A marked difference in distal/proximal intragastric distribution between UDP and SP was present (7{\%} versus 40{\%}; p {\textless} 0.01). Gastric-emptying time was similar but emptying pattern was linear in UDP and exponential in SP. Peristalsis was slower in UDP than SP (2.75 versus 2.96 min-1; p {\textless} 0.01), but no correlation was found between peristaltic frequency and the rate of gastric emptying in either position. Postprandial volume response (gastric relaxation) was greater in UDP than SP (280 versus 250 ml; p {\textless} 0.05). A correlation was found between gastric relaxation and gastric-emptying time in SP (r2=0.46) but not in UDP.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The stomach maintains the rate of gastric emptying despite radical changes in body position and intragastric distribution of gastric contents. In SP, hydrostatic pressure (modulated by gastric tone) dictates the gastric emptying. In UDP, gastric emptying also appears to be mediated by continuous adaptation of gastric tone. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that the mechanism of gastric emptying resembles a "pressure pump" rather than a "peristaltic pump".},

abstract = {1. Results were collected from thirty-three published and unpublished studies of gastric emptying.  The volumes of the meals ranged from 50 to 1250 ml., and composition varied from pure carbohydrates to ordinary food.  2. From the published composition of the meals, their nutritive density, as kcal/ml. (4-18 KJ/ml.) was computed: it ranged from zero to 2-3 kcal/ml.  3. The volume of each meal, or test meal, delivered to the duodenum in 30 min was determined, assuming that gastric emptying was exponential.  4. The greater the nutritive density of a meal, the less was the volume transferred to the duodenum in 30 min.  The original volume of meal given was not a determinant of the rate of emptying (ml./min).  5. The slowing of gastric emptying with a meal of high nutritive density was not sufficient to prevent an increased rate of delivery of energy to the duodenum (nutritive density times volume delivered in unit time) with a meal of high nutritive density.  6. Assuming an appropriate relationship for the interaction of a stimulus (kcal/ml.) and duodenal receptors, it was possible to predict a rate of gastric emptying for each meal, given its nutritive density.  Knowing the initial volume of the meal, it was possible to predict the mean half time for its emptying.  7. There were eight sets of anomalous results: in four the volumes of meal given were less than 200 ml.; explanations of the anomalies in the other four results could not be provided.  8. The results are consistent with equal slowing of gastric emptying by the duodenal action of the products of digestion of isocaloric amounts of fat, protein and carbohydrate, for example, 4 g fat or 9 g carbohydrate, both 36 kcal, taking carbohydrate and protein as 4 kcal/g and fat as 9 kcal/g.},

abstract = {Drug absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a highly complex process dependent upon numerous factors including the physicochemical properties of the drug, characteristics of the formulation and interplay with the underlying physiological properties of the GI tract. The ability to accurately predict oral drug absorption during drug product development is becoming more relevant given the current challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling provides an approach that enables the plasma concentration-time profiles to be predicted from preclinical in vitro and in vivo data and can thus provide a valuable resource to support decisions at various stages of the drug development process. Whilst there have been quite a few successes with PBPK models identifying key issues in the development of new drugs in vivo, there are still many aspects that need to be addressed in order to maximize the utility of the PBPK models to predict drug absorption, including improving our understanding of conditions in the lower small intestine and colon, taking the influence of disease on GI physiology into account and further exploring the reasons behind population variability. Importantly, there is also a need to create more appropriate in vitro models for testing dosage form performance and to streamline data input from these into the PBPK models. As part of the Oral Biopharmaceutical Tools (OrBiTo) project, this review provides a summary of the current status of PBPK models available. The current challenges in PBPK set-ups for oral drug absorption including the composition of GI luminal contents, transit and hydrodynamics, permeability and intestinal wall metabolism are discussed in detail. Further, the challenges regarding the appropriate integration of results from in vitro models, such as consideration of appropriate integration/estimation of solubility and the complexity of the in vitro release and precipitation data, are also highlighted as important steps to advancing the application of PBPK models in drug development. It is expected that the "innovative" integration of in vitro data from more appropriate in vitro models and the enhancement of the GI physiology component of PBPK models, arising from the OrBiTo project, will lead to a significant enhancement in the ability of PBPK models to successfully predict oral drug absorption and advance their role in preclinical and clinical development, as well as for regulatory applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intestinal chemosensory receptors and transporters are able to detect food-derived molecules and are involved in the modulation of gut hormone release. Gut hormones play an important role in the regulation of food intake and the control of gastrointestinal functioning. This mechanism is often referred to as "nutrient sensing". Knowledge of the distribution of chemosensors along the intestinal tract is important to gain insight in nutrient detection and sensing, both pivotal processes for the regulation of food intake. However, most knowledge is derived from rodents, whereas studies in man and pig are limited, and cross-species comparisons are lacking. AIM: To characterize and compare intestinal expression patterns of genes related to nutrient sensing in mice, pigs and humans. METHODS: Mucosal biopsy samples taken at six locations in human intestine (n = 40) were analyzed by qPCR. Intestinal scrapings from 14 locations in pigs (n = 6) and from 10 locations in mice (n = 4) were analyzed by qPCR and microarray, respectively. The gene expression of glucagon, cholecystokinin, peptide YY, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, taste receptor T1R3, sodium/glucose cotransporter, peptide transporter-1, GPR120, taste receptor T1R1, GPR119 and GPR93 was investigated. Partial least squares (PLS) modeling was used to compare the intestinal expression pattern between the three species. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The studied genes were found to display specific expression patterns along the intestinal tract. PLS analysis showed a high similarity between human, pig and mouse in the expression of genes related to nutrient sensing in the distal ileum, and between human and pig in the colon. The gene expression pattern was most deviating between the species in the proximal intestine. Our results give new insights in interspecies similarities and provide new leads for translational research and models aiming to modulate food intake processes in man.},

Polycose, a polymer of glucose, was chosen as a soluble homolog of food. The results of 1134 Polycose meals were analyzed in terms of the rates of energy delivery to the duodenum. The rates of emptying in the initial 30 min were significantly greater than in either the 30-60- or 60-120-min periods. Increases in either energy density or meal volume increased the rate of energy delivery in all time periods (p less than 0.001). The steady rate of energy delivery, which was evident after the initial 30 min, was correlated with increases in the initial meal volume and energy density, such that doubling the volume of meals from 300 to 600 ml increased the rate of emptying by a mean of 0.72 kcal/min, whereas doubling the energy density of the meals from 0.7 to 1.3 kcal/ml raised the rate of emptying by 0.62 kcal/min, with an overall mean rate of caloric emptying of 2.5 kcal/min. Thus, increases in either the initial volumes or the energy densities of the test meals significantly increased the rate of acceptance of energy by the duodenum.},

abstract = {Exposure of the small intestine to acid inhibits gastric emptying in a dose-related fashion that depends on titratable acidity and pH. Little information is available on the location of this inhibitory mechanism or on the relative contribution of titratable acidity and pH to this feedback control. We hypothesized that the dependence on titratable acidity is related to the length of the intestine exposed to acid and that the dependence on pH is related to the region of the intestine exposed to acid. To test these ideas, we studied 11 dogs with duodenal and jejunal fistulas. The inhibitory effects were tested when different lengths of the small intestine were exposed to test solutions of 0.03, 0.06, and 0.12 meq/ml titratable acidities. pH as an independent covariable was separated from titratable acidity by comparing the inhibition of gastric emptying of lactic acid (pH fixed to 2.4) to HCl (pH 0.96-1.6). Maximal inhibition of gastric emptying by both acids depended on acid exposure of a length of small intestine that was greater than 65 but less than or equal to 150 cm long. When acid was confined to the proximal 15 cm, increasing concentration of HCl (decreasing pH) resulted in increasing inhibition, but this effect was absent with increasing concentration of lactic acid (fixed pH). Inhibition was absent when 0.06 meq/ml HCl was infused into the intestine beyond the midintestine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Delayed gastric emptying is one of the reasons why functional dyspepsia (FD) occurs. The 13C-acetate breath test is widely used to evaluate gastric emptying. Nevertheless, the standard value of 13C-acetate breath test has not taken into account the gender difference of gastric emptying among healthy individuals. The main aim of this study was to readjust the standard value of 13C-acetate breath test in the light of gender differences. In addition, we clarified the prevalence and clinical characteristics of delayed gastric emptying in patients with FD using the modified standard values of 13C-acetate breath test. METHODS: Fifty-two healthy individuals and 126 patients with patients with FD were enrolled. Gastric emptying was evaluated by the 13C-acetate breath test. The cut-off points of Tmax for the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying were determined on the basis of results from healthy individuals making a distinction of genders. Gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, dyspeptic symptoms, scores of anxiety and depression, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking and alcohol consumption were compared between the delayed gastric emptying group and the non-delayed gastric emptying group. RESULTS: Since gastric emptying was delayed in healthy women compared with that in healthy men (Tmax, 53.6 +/- 19.3 vs. 42.7 +/- 16.9 min, p = 0.04), we set the cut-off points of Tmax at 60 min in men and at 75 min in women. In patients with FD, the prevalence of delayed gastric emptying was not different between men and women with the modified standard values of 13C-acetate breath test. (31.0 vs. 27.4{\%}, p = 0.68). BMI was lower in the delayed gastric emptying group than in the non-delayed group among the male patients. Reflux symptoms were more severe in delayed gastric emptying group than in the non-delayed group among the female patients. CONCLUSION: The standard values of 13C-acetate breath test should be modified bearing the gender difference in mind. It provides us more appropriate information to understand the mechanisms of FD.},

abstract = {Two new formulations, respectively denominated INT{\_}M1 and INT{\_}M2, of an integrated mathematical model to describe the glycemic and insulinemic responses to a 75. g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are proposed and compared. The INT{\_}M1 assumes a single compartment for the intestine and the derivative of a power exponential function for the gastric emptying rate, while, in the INT{\_}M2, a nonlinear three-compartment system model is adopted to produce a more realistic, multiphase gastric emptying rate. Both models were implemented in a Matlab-based, two-step procedure for estimation of seven adjustable coefficients characterizing the gastric emptying rate and the incretin, insulin and glucose kinetics. Model behaviour was tested vs. mean plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucose and insulin measurements from two different laboratories, where glycemic profiles observed during a 75. g OGTT were matched in healthy subjects (HC1- and HC2-group, respectively) by means of an isoglycemic intravenous glucose (I-IVG) infusion. Under the hypothesis of an additive effect of GLP-1 and GIP on insulin potentiation, our results demonstrated a substantial equivalence of the two models in matching the data. Model parameter estimates showed to be suitable markers of differences observed in the OGTT and matched I-IVG responses from the HC1-group compared to the HC2-group. Model implementation in our two-step parameter estimation procedure enhances the possibility of a prospective application for individualization of the incretin effect in a single subject, when his/her data are plugged in. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Increased postprandial gastric sensation was more frequent among H pylori positive patients (4/5 H pylori positive versus 4/12 H pylori negative patients). Intragastric meal distribution and orocaecal transit were normal; gastric emptying at four hours was abnormal in 4/17 patients. Vagal dysfunction was rare. Eight of 17 patients had somatisation or depression on MMPI.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Impaired gastric accommodation is frequent in non-ulcer dyspepsia and seems to be unrelated to vagal efferent dysfunction. H pylori infection does not seem to influence gastric accommodation, but is associated with heightened sensitivity in dyspeptics. Therapeutic approaches that restore normal postprandial accommodation and gastric sensitivity should be tested in non-ulcer dyspepsia.},

abstract = {Our aim was to test the hypothesis that there is a relation between antral phasic pressure activity and the emptying of solids and liquids from the intact human stomach after a mixed meal. This hypothesis was evaluated in 14 healthy individuals in whom we performed simultaneous antral manometry and radioscintigraphy after ingestion of a meal labeled with [99mTc]sulfur colloid in cooked egg (solid component) and [111In]DTPA (liquid component). Analysis of the data included an in-depth evaluation of different models for expressing both gastric emptying rates and antral pressure activity. We found that gastric emptying was adequately represented by a two-phase model consisting of lag and emptying periods and by a power exponential model for the liquid phase. Distal antral motility was accurately represented by the slope of the cumulative antral motility index. During the lag period for solids, the antral motility was inversely related to the duration of the lag. During the solid-emptying period, there was a positive correlation between emptying of solids and antral motility. No significant relation was found between antral motility and overall emptying of the liquid phase of the meal. However, a relationship was found when antral motility was related to liquid emptying after an initial lag period for solids. These human data are consistent with a role of antral pressure activity in trituration of solid food and a role of the antrum in the subsequent propulsion of solids and liquids from the stomach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES The changes in blood glucose concentrations that result from an oral glucose challenge are dependent on the rate of gastric emptying, the rate of glucose absorption and the rate of insulin-driven metabolism that include the incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The rate of insulin-driven metabolism is clearly altered in obese subjects, but it is controversial which of these factors is predominant. We aimed to quantify gastric emptying, plasma insulin, C-peptide, glucagon and glucose responses, as well as incretin hormone secretions in obese subjects and healthy controls during increasing glucose loads. SUBJECTS/METHODS The study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial in a hospital research unit. A total of 12 normal weight (6 men and 6 women) and 12 non-diabetic obese (BMI {\textgreater} 30, 6 men and 6 women) participants took part in the study. Subjects received intragastric loads of 10 g, 25 g and 75 g glucose dissolved in 300 ml tap water. RESULTS Main outcome measures were plasma GLP-1 and GIP, plasma glucagon, glucose, insulin, C-peptide and gastric emptying. The primary findings are: i) insulin resistance (P {\textless} 0.001) and hyperinsulinemia (P {\textless} 0.001); ii) decreased insulin disposal (P {\textless} 0.001); iii) trend for reduced GLP-1 responses at 75 g glucose; and iv) increased fasting glucagon levels (P {\textless} 0.001) in obese subjects. CONCLUSIONS It seems that, rather than changes in incretin secretion, fasting hyperglucagonemia and consequent hyperglycemia play a role in reduced disposal of insulin, contributing to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.

The model also takes into account the viscosity of nutrient meals upon gastric secretions and emptying. The results show that modelling the nutrient feedback mechanism as an on/off system, with an initial emptying rate dependent upon the secretion rate (which is a function of the gastric chyme viscosity) provides a good fit to the trends of emptying rate for liquid meals of low and high nutrient content with varying viscosity.},

abstract = {The infusion of triglyceride emulsions into the terminal ileum in concentrations that approximate those found in malabsorption results in the slowing of gastric emptying. The aim of this study was to characterize the changes in gastroduodenal motility responsible for this effect. Antropyloroduodenal pressures in 8 healthy volunteers were recorded with a manometric assembly incorporating a sleeve sensor across the pylorus and side holes in the antrum and duodenum. Each subject ingested a 100-g, 99m Tc-labeled solid meal; when approximately 25{\%} of the meal had emptied from the stomach, a triglyceride emulsion (20{\%} Intralipid) was infused into the terminal ileum at 1 ml/min for 45 min. Gastric emptying slowed markedly 15-30 min after the start of the lipid infusion (p = 0.01), and there was retrograde movement of the solid meal from the distal to the proximal portion of the stomach. During lipid infusion, there was a decrease in antral (p = 0.01), duodenal (p less than 0.05), and propagated antropyloroduodenal pressure waves (p less than 0.05) and an increase in isolated pyloric pressure waves (p less than 0.05). The rate of gastric emptying correlated with antral pressure waves (r = 0.92, p less than 0.001), duodenal pressure waves (r = 0.80, p less than 0.01), and propagated pressure waves (r = 0.88, p = 0.0025) and correlated inversely with the number of isolated pyloric pressure waves (r = -0.60, p = 0.05). The changes in antral, pyloric, and duodenal motility and the intragastric redistribution of a solid meal associated with ileal lipid infusion are likely to contribute to the delay in gastric emptying caused by this stimulus.},

abstract = {With the rising prevalence of obesity and related health problems increases, there is increased interest in the gastrointestinal system as a possible target for pharmacological or food-based approaches to weight management. Recent studies have shown that under normal physiological situations undigested nutrients can reach the ileum, and induce activation of the so-called "ileal brake", a combination of effects influencing digestive process and ingestive behaviour. The relevance of the ileal brake as a potential target for weight management is based on several findings: First, activation of the ileal brake has been shown to reduce food intake and increase satiety levels. Second, surgical procedures that increase exposure of the ileum to nutrients produce weight loss and improved glycaemic control. Third, the appetite-reducing effect of chronic ileal brake activation appears to be maintained over time. Together, this evidence suggests that activation of the ileal brake is an excellent long-term target to achieve sustainable reductions in food intake. This review addresses the role of the ileal brake in gut function, and considers the possible involvement of several peptide hormone mediators. Attention is given to the ability of macronutrients to activate the ileal brake, and particularly variation attributable to the physicochemical properties of fats. The emphasis is on implications of ileal brake stimulation on food intake and satiety, accompanied by evidence of effects on glycaemic control and weight loss. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The "ileal brake" is the primary inhibitory feedback mechanism to control transit of a meal through the gastrointestinal tract in order to optimize nutrient digestion and absorption. Neurohormonal factors mediating this response continue to be identified. Recently, additional brakes that fine-tune transit have been described. When gut traffic control is disrupted, pathologic states characterized by malabsorption and impaired drug bioavailability manifest as diarrhea and malnutrition. An understanding of the importance of these nutrient-triggered brakes provides essential clues to future treatments of chronic diarrhea, malnutrition, and drug malabsorption.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Specialized endoderm-derived epithelial cells, that is, enteroendocrine cells (EECs), are widely distributed throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Enteroendocrine cells form the largest endocrine organ in the body and play a key role in the control of GI secretion and motility, the regulation of food intake, postprandial glucose levels and metabolism. EECs sense luminal content and release signaling molecules that can enter the circulation to act as classic hormones on distant targets, act locally on neighboring cells and on distinct neuronal pathways including enteric and extrinsic neurons. Recent studies have shed light on EEC sensory transmission by showing direct connections between EECs and the nervous system via axon-like processes that form a well-defined neuroepithelial circuits through which EECs can directly communicate with the neurons innervating the GI tract to initiate appropriate functional responses. PURPOSE This review will highlight the role played by the EECs in the complex and integrated sensory information responses, and discuss the new findings regarding EECs in the brain-gut axis bidirectional communication.},

abstract = {Endothelial function, measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), predicts cardiovascular events and is impaired postprandially. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of changes in composition or duration of ingestion of a meal, which slows gastric emptying and/or small intestinal nutrient exposure, on postprandial endothelial function. Twelve healthy subjects (6 male, 6 female, 33+/-6 yr) were each studied on three occasions, in a randomized crossover design. After an overnight fast, subjects consumed a [13C]octanoic acid-labeled mashed potato meal ("meal 1"), or meal 1 mixed with 9 g guar ("meal 2") within 10 min, or meal 1 divided into 12 equal portions over 60 min ("meal 3"). Brachial artery FMD was measured every 30 min for 120 min. Blood glucose, serum insulin, and gastric emptying (breath test) were evaluated for 240 min. Data are means +/-SE. Compared with meal 1, meal 2 was associated with slower gastric emptying (half-emptying time 285 +/- 27 vs. 208 +/- 15 min, P {\textless} 0.05), lower postprandial blood glucose and insulin (P {\textless} 0.001 for both), and a delayed, but more sustained, suppression of FMD (P {\textless} 0.001). After meal 3, both glycemic increment and reduction in FMD were less than after meal 2 (P {\textless} 0.05 for both). The decrement in FMD was directly related to the increment in blood glucose (r = 0.46, P = 0.02). We conclude that, in health, postprandial FMD is influenced by perturbation of gastric emptying and the duration of meal consumption, which also impact on glycemia.},

abstract = {The effects of three variations in meal composition (a solid and a liquid meal consumed together, a liquid meal consumed alone, and a liquid meal consumed 90 min after a solid meal) on the rates and patterns of solid and liquid gastric emptying were examined in 13 volunteers. By including alcohol (0.5 g/kg body wt) in the liquid meal, the relationship between alcohol absorption and gastric emptying was also assessed. The lag phase and the initial emptying phase of the solid meal were prolonged (P less than 0.001) when the liquid meal was consumed with the solid meal, compared with when the liquid meal was consumed 90 min after the solid meal. In this latter situation, consumption of the liquid meal caused the cessation of emptying of solid food, and this second lag phase was followed by a slower (P less than 0.001) than initial emptying phase. Gastric emptying of the liquid meal was slower (P less than 0.005) when solid food was present and was slowest (P less than 0.05) when liquid was consumed 90 min after the solid meal. Alcohol absorption was fastest (P less than 0.05) when the liquid meal was consumed alone and slower (P less than 0.01) when alcohol was consumed with or after the solid meal. For all three meals there was a close correlation (r greater than or equal to 0.91; P less than 0.001) between alcohol absorption and liquid emptying. We conclude that gastric emptying of liquid may be influenced by solid food and that the rate and pattern of solid emptying may be modified by the presence of liquid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {This review of the pathophysiologic basis for gastroparesis and recent advances in the treatment of patients with gastroparesis shows that there are several novel approaches to advance treatment of gastroparesis including diet, novel prokinetics, interventions on the pylorus, and novel forms of gastric electrical stimulation. The field of gastroparesis is likely to advance with further studies, with help from a guidance document from the Food and Drug Administration on gastroparesis, and with recent approval of the stable isotope gastric emptying test to ensure eligibility of participants in multicenter trials. Clinical experience and a formal, randomized, controlled trial provide insights on optimizing dietary interventions in patients with gastroparesis. This review addresses the biologic rationale of these different treatments, based on known physiology and pathophysiology of gastric emptying. The novel medications include the motilin agonist, camicinal; 5-HT4 receptor agonists, such as velusetrag; and the ghrelin agonist, relamorelin. New approaches target pylorospasm by stent placement, endoscopic pyloric myotomy, or laparoscopic pyloroplasty. These approaches offer the opportunity to achieve more permanent reduction of resistance to flow at the pylorus over the intrapyloric injection of botulinum toxin, which typically has to be repeated every few months if it is efficacious. A novel device, deployed in porcine stomach, involved per-endoscopic electrical stimulation. These promising approaches require formal, randomized, controlled trials and deployment in patients. The presence of concomitant antral hypomotility may be a significant factor in the responsiveness to interventions at the pylorus.},

abstract = {Effects of altered gastric emptying on glucose absorption and kinetics are not well understood in non-diabetic obese adults. The aim of this work was to develop a physiology-based model that can characterize and compare interactions among gastric emptying, glucose absorption and glycemic control in non-diabetic obese and lean healthy adults. Dynamic glucose, insulin and gastric emptying (measured with breath test) data from 12 non-diabetic obese and 12 lean healthy adults were available until 180 minutes after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 10g, 25g and 75g of glucose. A physiology-based model was developed to characterize glucose kinetics applying nonlinear mixed-effects modelling with NONMEM7.3. Glucose kinetics after OGTT was described by a one-compartment model with an effect compartment to describe delayed insulin effects on glucose clearance. After accounting for interactions between individual gastric emptying and glucose absorption profiles the glucose absorption rate was found to be similar in non-diabetic obese and lean controls. Baseline glucose concentration was estimated to be only marginally higher in non-diabetic obese subjects (4.9 versus 5.2 mmol.L(-1)), whereas insulin-dependent glucose clearance in non-diabetic obese subjects was found to be cut in half compared to lean controls (0.052 versus 0.029 L.min(-1)) and insulin concentration associated with 50{\%} of insulin-dependent glucose elimination rate was {\~{}}2-fold higher in non-diabetic obese subjects compared to lean controls (7.1 versus 15.3 $\mu$U.mL(-1)). Physiology-based models can characterize and compare the dynamic interaction among gastric emptying, glucose absorption and glycemic control in populations of interest such as lean healthy and non-diabetic obese adults.},

abstract = {The nutrient-dependent glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) release was studied in comparison to the glucose-dependent insulin-releasing polypeptide (GIP) response in 10 healthy volunteers each undergoing various protocols. Plasma samples were saved up to 120 min after challenges by oral, intravenous or intraduodenal administration of nutrients. Basal plasma-GLP-1 concentrations ranged between 0.4 and 1.4 pM, maximal postprandial GLP-1 levels peaked between 10 and 12 pM. Intravenous glucose (25 g i.v.) did not change basal GLP-1 levels. Oral administration of glucose (50 g) induced a biphasic GLP-1 release peaking at 30-60 min and a biphasic GIP release peaking at 5 and 45 min. This increase paralleled the secretion of insulin. Oral galactose (100 g) and amino acids (25 g) also induced a rapid plasma GLP-1 response. After fat (67 g corn oil) a strong and long-lasting ({\textgreater} 120 min) increase of GLP-1 plasma levels occurred. When a mixed liquid meal was given (6 g soybean oil, 5 g casein, 13 g glucose) immunoreactive (IR)-GLP-1 rapidly increased and peaked after 5 min with declining levels after 30 min. In response to an intraduodenal infusion of a small glucose load (5.34 g within 120 min) a rapid, short-lasting GLP-1 response occurred whereas plasma GIP and insulin levels remained unaltered. Luminal perfusion of an isolated vascularly perfused rat ileum with a polydiet induced a rapid rise of portally released IR-GLP-1 which was followed by a sustained release. Glucose evoked sodium-dependently a sharp increase of IR-GLP-1 levels followed by a plateau release. The intraluminal infusion of a mixture of amino acids or fat was without any effect on IR-GLP-1. We hypothesize that in contrast to GIP the GLP-1 release from L cells is triggered by nervous reflexes, by putative humoral factor(s) being released from the upper small intestine in addition to nutrient stimuli acting at the luminal surface of the gut.},

abstract = {Following glucose ingestion, tissue glucose uptake is enhanced and endogenous glucose production is inhibited, thus contributing to the maintenance of normal glucose tolerance. To examine whether these responses are disturbed in diabetes, glucose kinetics after oral glucose administration were studied in 12 non-insulin-dependent diabetic and 10 age- and weight-matched control subjects. A double tracer approach was used, whereby the endogenous glucose pool was labeled with 3-3H-glucose and the oral load with 1-14C-glucose. The two glucose tracers were separated in plasma by a two-step chromatographic procedure, and the two sets of isotopic data were analyzed according to a two-compartment model for the glucose system. Basally, glucose production was slightly higher in diabetics than in controls (2.51 ± 0.24 v 2.28 ± 0.11 mg/kg {\textperiodcentered} min, NS) even though the former had higher plasma glucose (189 ± 19 v 93 ± 2 mg/dL, P {\textless} .001) and insulin (23 ± 4 v 12 ± 1 $\mu$U/mL, P {\textless} .05) concentrations. Following the ingestion of 1 g/kg of glucose, oral glucose appeared in the peripheral circulation in similar time-course and amount in the two groups (75 ± 2{\%} of the load over 3.5 hours in the diabetics v 76 ± 3{\%} in controls). Endogenous glucose production was promptly inhibited in diabetic and normal subjects alike, but the mean residual hepatic glucose production after glucose ingestion was significantly greater in the diabetic group (17 ± 2 v 10 ± 3 g/3.5 h, P {\textless} .05). At the end of the 3.5-hour study period, hepatic glucose production was still partially suppressed in both groups (by about 50{\%}). This impairment in suppression of hepatic glucose production in the diabetics occurred despite the presence of marked hyperglycemia (mean plasma glucose following glucose ingestion = 298 ± 23 v 147 ± 7 mg/dL in controls, P {\textless} .001) and similar plasma insulin concentrations (46 ± 10 v 60 ± 7 $\mu$U/mL, NS). In the diabetics, endogenous glucose production was directly correlated with plasma glucose concentration both basally (r = .92, P {\textless} .001) and after glucose (r = .63, P {\textless} .05). At the end of 3.5 hours the healthy subjects had disposed of 60 ± 4 g by tissue uptake; this amount represented nearly 100{\%} of the glucose (both oral and endogenous) that had appeared in the peripheral circulation. In contrast, in the diabetics tissue glucose disposal was only 44 ± 4 g over 3.5 hours (P {\textless} .05 v controls); 11 ± 3 g were lost into the urine and 16 ± 3 g had accumulated in the glucose space. In the diabetic group the mean plasma glucose concentration postload was inversely correlated with tissue glucose disposal (r = -.70, P {\textless} .01). We conclude that, in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients: (1) the peripheral appearance of an ingested glucose load follows a normal pattern; (2) suppression of endogenous glucose production after oral glucose ingestion is impaired when compared with controls despite a twofold higher plasma glucose concentration and comparable plasma insulin levels; (3) tissue uptake of oral and endogenous glucose is markedly impaired; and (4) reduced tissue glucose uptake and relative overproduction of glucose by the liver both contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Despite important empirical findings, current models of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) do not incorporate the essential contributions of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In order to address this deficiency, a model was, therefore, developed in which the incretins, as well as a term reflecting net hepatic glucose balance, were included. Equations modeling the changes in incretins, hepatic glucose balance, insulin and glucose were used to simulate the responses to 50 and 100 g oral glucose loads under normal conditions. The model successfully captures main trends in mean data from the literature using a simple 'lumped-parameter,' single-compartment approach in which the majority of the parameters were matched to known clinical data. The accuracy of the model and its applicability to understanding fundamental mechanisms was further assessed using a variety of glycemic and insulinemic challenges beyond those which the model was originally created to encompass, including hyper- and hypoinsulinemia, changes in insulin sensitivity, and the insulin infusion-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test.},

abstract = {A reliable model of glucose absorption after oral ingestion may facilitate simulation as well as pathophysiological studies. One of the difficulties for the development and quality assessment of such models has been the lack of gold standard data for their validation. Thus, while data on plasma concentrations of glucose are available, the rates of appearance in plasma of ingested glucose (Ra) were not available to develop such models. Here we utilize the recent availability of Ra data, estimated with a model-independent multiple tracer technique, to formulate a system model of intestinal glucose absorption. Two published and two new models are tested on this new data set. One of the two new models performed best: it is nonlinear, describes the Ra data well and its parameters are estimated with good precision. This model has important potential both in simulation contexts, e.g., it can be incorporated in whole-body models of the glucose regulatory system, as well as in physiological and clinical studies to quantitatively characterize possible impairment of glucose absorption in particular populations such as elderly and diabetic individuals},

abstract = {Numerous studies have used the dual-tracer method to assess postprandial glucose metabolism. The present experiments were undertaken to determine whether the marked tracer nonsteady state that occurs with the dual-tracer approach after food ingestion introduces error when it is used to simultaneously measure both meal glucose appearance (R(a meal)) and endogenous glucose production (EGP). To do so, a novel triple-tracer approach was designed: 12 subjects ingested a mixed meal containing [1-(13)C]glucose while [6-(3)H]glucose and [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose were infused intravenously in patterns that minimized the change in the plasma ratios of [6-(3)H]glucose to [1-(13)C]glucose and of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose to endogenous glucose, respectively. R(a meal) and EGP measured with this approach were essentially model independent, since non-steady-state error was minimized by the protocol. Initial splanchnic glucose extraction (ISE) was 12.9{\%} +/- 3.4{\%}, and suppression of EGP (EGPS) was 40.3{\%} +/- 4.1{\%}. In contrast, when calculated with the dual-tracer one-compartment model, ISE was higher (P {\textless} 0.05) and EGPS was lower (P {\textless} 0.005) than observed with the triple-tracer approach. These errors could only be prevented by using time-varying volumes different for R(a meal) and EGP. Analysis of the dual-tracer data with a two-compartment model reduced but did not totally avoid the problems associated with marked postprandial changes in the tracer-to-tracee ratios. We conclude that results from previous studies that have used the dual-tracer one-compartment model to measure postprandial carbohydrate metabolism need to be reevaluated and that the triple-tracer technique may provide a useful approach for doing so.},

abstract = {Measuring insulin sensitivity in the presence of physiological changes in glucose and insulin concentrations, e.g., during a meal or OGTT, is important to better understand insulin resistance in a variety of metabolic conditions. Recently, two oral minimal models have been proposed to measure overall insulin sensitivity (S(I)) and its selective effect on glucose disposal (S(I)*) from oral tests. S(I) and S(I)* have been successfully validated against multiple tracer meal estimates, but validation against euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp estimates is lacking. Here, we do so in 21 subjects who underwent both a multiple-tracer OGTT and a labeled euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Correlation between minimal-model S(I), S(I) and corresponding clamp estimates S(I)(*clamp), S(I)(*clamp) was satisfactory, respectively r = 0.81, P {\textless} 0.001, and r = 0.71, P {\textless} 0.001. S(I) was significantly lower than S(I)(clamp) (8.08 +/- 0.89 vs. 13.66 +/- 1.69 10(-4) dl.kg(-1).min(-1) per microU/ml, P = 0.0002), whereas S(I) and S(I)(*clamp) were very similar (8.17 +/- 1.59 vs. 8.84 +/- 1.39 10(-4) dl.kg(-1).min(-1) per microU/ml, P = 0.52). These results add credibility to the oral minimal-model method as a simple and reliable physiological tool to estimate S(I) and S(I)*, also in large-scale clinical trials.},

abstract = {Aim To determine the extent of gender-related differences in the
prevalence of glucose intolerance for the Australian population and
whether body size may explain such differences.
Methods Cross-sectional data were collected from a national cohort of 11
247 Australians aged {\textgreater}= 25 years. Glucose tolerance status was assessed
according to both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h plasma glucose
(2hPG) levels following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
Anthropometric and glycated haemoglobin measurements were also made.
Results Undiagnosed diabetes and non-diabetic glucose abnormalities were
more prevalent among men than women when based only on the FPG results
(diabetes: men 2.2{\%}, women 1.6{\%}, P = 0.02; impaired fasting glycaemia:
men 12.3{\%}, women 6.6{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). In contrast 16.0{\%} of women and
13.0{\%} of men had a 2hPG abnormality (either diabetes or impaired
glucose tolerance, P = 0.14). Women had a mean FPG 0.3 mmol/l lower than
men (P {\textless} 0.001), but 2hPG 0.3 mmol/l higher (P = 0.002) and FPG-2hPG
increment 0.5 mmol/l greater (P {\textless} 0.001). The gender difference in mean
2hPG and FPG-2hPG increment disappeared following adjustment for height.
For both genders, those in the shortest height quartile had 2hPG levels
0.5 mmol/l higher than the tallest quartile, but height showed almost no
relationship with the FPG.
Conclusions Men and women had different glycaemic profiles; women had
higher mean 2hPG levels, despite lower fasting levels. It appeared that
the higher 2hPG levels for women related to lesser height and may be a
consequence of using a fixed glucose load in the OGTT, irrespective of
body size.},

In healthy individuals, interd gestive variations in gastric tone were phaselocked iii advance of duodenal interdigestive motor activity and consisted of three sequential periods: a quiescence period, an intermediate period, and a period of activity. In contrast to controls, gastroparetic patients presented significantly larger intragastric volume at low intragastric pressure (6 mmHg). Gastric distention (14 mmHg) resulted in significantly reduced extension ratio and phasic motor response in the gastric remnant. Furthermore, distention elicited a symptomatic response that resembled their postcibal syndrome (epigastric fullness, pain, nausea). These data suggest that postsurgical gastroparesis is associated with impaired tone of the residual gastric pouch. {\textcopyright} 1987, American Gastroenterological Association.

Physicians are often facing problem on appropriate drug dosing, efficient treatment, and drug safety for a female in general. To identify and synthesize evidence about the effectiveness of gender-based therapy; provide the information to patients, providers, and health system intervention to ensure safety treatment; and minimize adverse effects. METHODS We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effect of gender difference on pharmacotherapy. Published articles from January 1990 to December 2015 were identified using specific term in MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane library according to search strategies that strengthen the reporting of observational and clinical studies. RESULTS Twenty-six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this systematic review, yielding a total of 6309 subjects. We observed that female generally has a lower the gastric emptying time, gastric PH, lean body mass, and higher plasma volume, BMI, body fat, as well as reduce hepatic clearance, difference in activity of Cytochrome P450 enzyme, and metabolize drugs at different rate compared with male. Other significant factors such as conjugation, protein binding, absorption, and the renal elimination could not be ignored. However, these differences can lead to adverse effects in female especially for the pregnant, post-menopausal, and elderly women. CONCLUSION This systematic review provides an evidence for the effectiveness of dosage difference to ensure safety and efficient treatment. Future studies on the current topic are, therefore, recommended to reduce the adverse effect of therapy.},

abstract = {The rate of appearance (R(a)) of exogenous glucose in plasma after glucose ingestion is presently measured by tracer techniques that cannot be used in standard clinical testing such as the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We propose a mathematical model that represents in a simple way the gastric emptying, the transport of glucose along the intestinal tract, and its absorption from gut lumen into portal blood. The model gives the R(a) time course in terms of parameters with a physiological counterpart and provides an expression for the release of incretin hormones as related to glucose transit into gut lumen. Glucose absorption was represented by assuming two components related to a proximal and a distal transporter. Model performance was evaluated by numerical simulations. The model was then validated by fitting OGTT glucose and GLP-1 data in healthy controls and type 2 diabetic patients, and useful information was obtained for the rate of gastric emptying, the rate of glucose absorption, the R(a) profile, the insulin sensitivity, and the glucose effectiveness. Model-derived estimates of insulin sensitivity were well correlated (r = 0.929 in controls and 0.886 in diabetic patients) to data obtained from the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Although the proposed OGTT analysis requires the measurement of an additional hormone concentration (GLP-1), it appears to be a reasonable choice since it avoids complex and expensive techniques, such as isotopes for glucose R(a) measurement and direct assessment of gastric emptying and intestinal transit, and gives additional correlated information, thus largely compensating for the extra expense.},

abstract = {In order to provide a method for precise identification of insulin sensitivity from clinical Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) observations, a relatively simple mathematical model (Simple Interdependent glucose/insulin MOdel SIMO) for the OGTT, which coherently incorporates commonly accepted physiological assumptions (incretin effect and saturating glucose-driven insulin secretion) has been developed. OGTT data from 78 patients in five different glucose tolerance groups were analyzed: normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), IFG+IGT, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). A comparison with the 2011 Salinari (COntinuos GI tract MOdel, COMO) and the 2002 Dalla Man (Dalla Man MOdel, DMMO) models was made with particular attention to insulin sensitivity indices ISCOMO, ISDMMO and kxgi (the insulin sensitivity index for SIMO). ANOVA on kxgi values across groups resulted significant overall (P{\textless}0.001), and post-hoc comparisons highlighted the presence of three different groups: NGT (8.62×10(-5)±9.36×10(-5) min(-1)pM(-1)), IFG (5.30×10(-5)±5.18×10(-5)) and combined IGT, IFG+IGT and T2DM (2.09×10(-5)±1.95×10(-5), 2.38×10(-5)±2.28×10(-5) and 2.38×10(-5)±2.09×10(-5) respectively). No significance was obtained when comparing ISCOMO or ISDMMO across groups. Moreover, kxgi presented the lowest sample average coefficient of variation over the five groups (25.43{\%}), with average CVs for ISCOMO and ISDMMO of 70.32{\%} and 57.75{\%} respectively; kxgi also presented the strongest correlations with all considered empirical measures of insulin sensitivity. While COMO and DMMO appear over-parameterized for fitting single-subject clinical OGTT data, SIMO provides a robust, precise, physiologically plausible estimate of insulin sensitivity, with which habitual empirical insulin sensitivity indices correlate well. The kxgi index, reflecting insulin secretion dependency on glycemia, also significantly differentiates clinically diverse subject groups. The SIMO model may therefore be of value for the quantification of glucose homeostasis from clinical OGTT data.},

abstract = {Objective: Recent preclinical work suggests that postprandial flow of bile acids into the small intestine potentiate nutrient-induced glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion via bile acid-induced activation of the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 in intestinal L cells. The notion of bile-induced GLP-1 secretion combined with findings of reduced postprandial gallbladder emptying in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) led us to speculate whether reduced postprandial GLP-1 responses in some patients with T2DM arise as a consequence of diabetic gallbladder dysmotility. Design and Methods: In a randomised design, 15 patients with long-standing T2DM and 15 healthy age, gender and BMI-matched control subjects were studied during 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and three isocaloric (500 kcal) and isovolaemic (350 ml) liquid meals: 1) 2.5 g fat, 107 g carbohydrate and 13 g protein; 2) 10 g fat, 93 g carbohydrate, 11 g protein; 3) 40 g fat, 32 g carbohydrate and 3 g protein. Basal and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin were measured. Furthermore, gallbladder emptying and gastric emptying were examined. Results: Gallbladder emptying increased with increasing meal fat content, but no intergroup differences were demonstrated. GIP and GLP-1 responses were comparable among the groups with GIP levels being higher following high fat meals, whereas GLP-1 secretion was similar after both OGTT and meals. Conclusions: In conclusion, patients with T2DM exhibited normal gallbladder emptying to meals with a wide range of fat content. Incretin responses were similar compared to controls, and an association to postprandial gallbladder contraction could not be demonstrated.},

The model was modified to incorporate a description of ethanol absorption from the stomach and gastro-intestinal tract and the retardation of gastric emptying due to a concentration-dependent inhibition of gastric peristalsis. In addition, intra-venous and intra-arterial routes of administration were added to investigate whether the biological structure of the model provided a core which may be easily adapted for any route of exposure.

abstract = {Several models of Gastric Emptying (GE) have been employed in the past to represent the rate of delivery of stomach contents to the duodenum and jejunum. These models have all used a deterministic form (algebraic equations or ordinary differential equations), considering GE as a continuous, smooth process in time. However, GE is known to occur as a sequence of spurts, irregular both in size and in timing. Hence, we formulate a simple stochastic process model, able to represent the irregular decrements of gastric contents after a meal. The model is calibrated on existing literature data and provides consistent predictions of the observed variability in the emptying trajectories. This approach may be useful in metabolic modeling, since it describes well and explains the apparently heterogeneous GE experimental results in situations where common gastric mechanics across subjects would be expected.},

abstract = {The gastric emptying of a mixed solid and liquid meal was assessed in 24 normal subjects using a single camera/computer system which allowed continuous monitoring of both solids and liquids. It was shown that variation in tissue attenuation caused by the changing depth of radionuclide within the stomach accounted for large errors in the measurement of gastric emptying (alteration in 50{\%} emptying time of up to 65{\%}). A technique for the correction of attenuation is described which used factors derived from a lateral image of the stomach. In all subjects, solid emptying was slower than liquid emptying and was characterised by a delay (lag period) which was followed by linear emptying. Liquid emptying usually followed a single exponential pattern. The effect of physiological changes induced by increasing the calorie content of the liquid component of the meal was assessed by giving either water, 10{\%} dextrose or 25{\%} dextrose. Liquid emptying was slowed and the lag period of solid was prolonged as the calorie content increased. Reproducibility was assessed in 19 subjects. For the three groups studied (water, 10{\%} dextrose, 25{\%} dextrose) the day-to-day variation in gastric emptying was not significant for any measured parameter, while statistically significant differences were present in solid and liquid emptying between subjects and groups.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In-silico models that attempt to capture and describe the physiological behavior of biological organisms, including humans, are intrinsically complex and time consuming to build and simulate in a computing environment. The level of detail of description incorporated in the model depends on the knowledge of the system's behavior at that level. This knowledge is gathered from the literature and/or improved by knowledge obtained from new experiments. Thus model development is an iterative developmental procedure. The objective of this paper is to describe a new plug and play scheme that offers increased flexibility and ease-of-use for modeling and simulating physiological behavior of biological organisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This scheme requires the modeler (user) first to supply the structure of the interacting components and experimental data in a tabular format. The behavior of the components described in a mathematical form, also provided by the modeler, is externally linked during simulation. The advantage of the plug and play scheme for modeling is that it requires less programming effort and can be quickly adapted to newer modeling requirements while also paving the way for dynamic model building.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: As an illustration, the paper models the dynamics of gastric emptying behavior experienced by humans. The flexibility to adapt the model to predict the gastric emptying behavior under varying types of nutrient infusion in the intestine (ileum) is demonstrated. The predictions were verified with a human intervention study. The error in predicting the half emptying time was found to be less than 6{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A new plug-and-play scheme for biological systems modeling was developed that allows changes to the modeled structure and behavior with reduced programming effort, by abstracting the biological system into a network of smaller sub-systems with independent behavior. In the new scheme, the modeling and simulation becomes an automatic machine readable and executable task.},

@article{Baggio2007,
abstract = {This review focuses on the mechanisms regulating the synthesis, secretion, biological actions, and therapeutic relevance of the incretin peptides glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The published literature was reviewed, with emphasis on recent advances in our understanding of the biology of GIP and GLP-1. GIP and GLP-1 are both secreted within minutes of nutrient ingestion and facilitate the rapid disposal of ingested nutrients. Both peptides share common actions on islet $\beta$-cells acting through structurally distinct yet related receptors. Incretin-receptor activation leads to glucose-dependent insulin secretion, induction of $\beta$-cell proliferation, and enhanced resistance to apoptosis. GIP also promotes energy storage via direct actions on adipose tissue, and enhances bone formation via stimulation of osteoblast proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. In contrast, GLP-1 exerts glucoregulatory actions via slowing of gastric emptying and glucose-dependent inhibition of glucagon secretion. GLP-1 also promotes satiety and sustained GLP-1-receptor activation is associated with weight loss in both preclinical and clinical studies. The rapid degradation of both GIP and GLP-1 by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 has led to the development of degradation-resistant GLP-1-receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These agents decrease hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) safely without weight gain in subjects with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 and GIP integrate nutrient-derived signals to control food intake, energy absorption, and assimilation. Recently approved therapeutic agents based on potentiation of incretin action provide new physiologically based approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. {\textcopyright} 2007 AGA Institute.},

Elevations in blood glucose that are within the normal postprandial range also affect gastrointestinal motor and sensory function. Upper gastrointestinal motor function is a critical determinant of postprandial blood glucose concentrations by influencing the absorption of ingested nutrients.

abstract = {Emerging evidence has suggested a possible physiologic role for peripheral glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in regulating glucose metabolism and food intake. The likely site of action of GLP-1 is on vagal afferent neuron (VAN). The vagal afferent pathway is a major neural pathway by which information about ingested nutrients reaches the central nervous system and influences feeding behavior. Peripheral GLP-1 acts on VANs to inhibit food intake. The mechanism of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is unlike other gut-derived receptors; GLP-1Rs change their cellular localization according to feeding status rather than their protein concentrations. It is possible that several gut peptides are involved in mediating GLP-1R translocation. The mechanism of peripheral GLP-1R translocation still needs to be elucidated. Here, we review data supporting the role of peripheral GLP-1 acting on VANs in influencing glucose homeostasis and feeding behavior. We highlight evidence demonstrating that GLP-1 interacts with ghrelin and leptin to induce satiation. Our aim was to understand the mechanism of peripheral GLP-1 to help develop noninvasive antiobesity treatments.},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to investigate the sensitivity of vagal mechanoreceptor afferent fibres from the stomach and small intestine to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 10 and 50 $\mu$g), and to relate this to motor activity. The discharge of single afferent fibres was recorded from the cervical vagus of Urethane anaesthetized ferrets. These had receptive fields in the corpus (15 fibres), antrum (11 fibres), duodenum (3 fibres) or jejunum (1 fibre), and their discharge was excited by distension of the segment containing the receptive field, or by mechanical probing. Conduction velocity was calculated in 7 fibres, and always fell in the C-fibre range (0.84 ± 0.07 m/s). Injection of 5-HT intra-arterially via the coeliac axis evoked both contraction and relaxation with the dominant effect dependent on region and dose of 5-HT. However, irrespective of the motor response, the mechanoreceptor discharge closely mirrored both the magnitude and the time-course of the motor response. The relationship between the changes in discharge of individual mechanoreceptors and change in intraluminal pressure in all regions in response to both doses of 5-HT fitted a linear regression y = 17.1 ± 1.2x and was highly significant (P {\textless} 0.0001), indicating that 5-HT has no modulatory effect on the sensitivity of mechanoreceptors to changes in intraluminal pressure. This study suggests that vagal mechanoreceptors supplying the gastroinestinal tract respond to changes in motor activity evoked by 5-HT, rather than to 5-HT directly. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), released from L-cells in the intestinal epithelium, plays an important role in postprandial glucose homeostasis and appetite control. Following the recent therapeutic successes of antidiabetic drugs aimed at either mimicking GLP-1 or preventing its degradation, attention is now turning towards the L-cell, and addressing whether it would be both possible and beneficial to stimulate the endogenous release of GLP-1 in vivo. Understanding the mechanisms underlying GLP-1 release from L-cells is key to this type of approach, and the use of cell line models has led to the identification of a variety of pathways that may underlie the physiological responses of L-cells to food ingestion. This review focuses on our current understanding of the signalling mechanisms that underlie L-cell nutrient responsiveness. It is widely recognized that the oral ingestion of glucose triggers more insulin release than a similar plasma glucose profile delivered intravenously – a phenomenon known as the 'incretin effect' . It is largely attributable to two hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which are released from the intestine in response to food ingestion, and have direct stimulatory effects on the pancreatic $\beta$-cell. The combined action of GLP-1 and GIP is believed to account for up to 70{\%} of the total insulin secretory response after a meal. Recent years have witnessed the development and licensing of a number of antidiabetic agents targeted towards the GLP-1 axis, both in the form of GLP-1 mimetics and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) (Drucker {\&} Nauck, 2006), the enzyme responsible for the rapid inactivation of GLP-1 in the circulation. These agents improve blood glucose control because they increase insulin release, reduce glucagon secretion and slow gastric emptying, and as the stimulation of insulin secretion is glucose dependent they carry a lower risk of provoking hypoglycaemic side-effects than many of the existing oral therapies. With prolonged treatment, GLP-1 mimetics also have beneficial effects on appetite and body weight, and have been shown to enhance $\beta$-cell mass as a consequence of promoting $\beta$-cell growth and},

abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an enteric hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and improves glycaemia in type 2 diabetes. Although GLP-1-based treatments are clinically available, alternative strategies to increase endogenous GLP-1 release from L cells are hampered by our limited physiological understanding of this cell type. By generating transgenic mice with L cell-specific expression of a fluorescent protein, we studied the characteristics of primary L cells by electrophysiology, fluorescence calcium imaging, and expression analysis and show that single L cells are electrically excitable and glucose responsive. Sensitivity to tolbutamide and low-millimolar concentrations of glucose and $\alpha$-methylglucopyranoside, assessed in single L cells and by hormone secretion from primary cultures, suggested that GLP-1 release is regulated by the activity of sodium glucose cotransporter 1 and ATP-sensitive K+ channels, consistent with their high expression levels in purified L cells by quantitative RT-PCR. These and other pathways identified using this approach will provide exciting opportunities for future physiological and therapeutic exploration. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Intestinal perfusion with carbohydrates inhibits gastric emptying via vagal and spinal capsaicin-sensitive afferent pathways. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of 1) 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(3) receptors (5-HT(3)R) in mediating glucose-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and 2) 5-HT(3)R expression in vagal and spinal afferents in innervating the duodenum. In awake rats fitted with gastric and duodenal cannulas, perfusion of the duodenum with glucose (50 and 100 mg) inhibited gastric emptying. Intestinal perfusion of mannitol inhibited gastric emptying only at the highest concentration (990 mosm/kgH(2)O). Pretreatment with the 5-HT(3)R antagonist tropisetron abolished both glucose- and mannitol-induced inhibition of gastric emptying. Retrograde labeling of visceral afferents by injection of dextran-conjugated Texas Red into the duodenal wall was used to identify extrinsic primary afferents. Immunoreactivity for 5-HT(3)R, visualized with an antibody directed to the COOH terminus of the rat 5-HT(3)R, was found in {\textgreater}80{\%} of duodenal vagal and spinal afferents. These results show that duodenal extrinsic afferents express 5-HT(3)R and that the receptor mediates specific glucose-induced inhibition of gastric emptying. These findings support the hypothesis that enterochromaffin cells in the intestinal mucosa release 5-HT in response to glucose, which activates 5-HT(3)R on afferent nerve terminals to evoke reflex changes in gastric motility. The primary glucose sensors of the intestine may be mucosal enterochromaffin cells.},

abstract = {Sensing nutrients is a fundamental task for all living cells. For most eukaryotic cells glucose is a major source of energy, having significant and varied effects on cell function. Interest in identifying mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to variations in glucose concentration has increased recently. The epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract are exposed, from the luminal domain, to an environment with continuous and massive fluctuations in the levels of dietary monosaccharides. Enterocytes therefore have to sense and respond to the significant changes in the levels of luminal sugars, and regulate the expression of the intestinal glucose transporter (Na+/glucose co-transporter, SGLT1) accordingly. Our data, using a combination of in vivo and in vitro model systems, suggest that glucose in the lumen of the intestine is sensed by a glucose sensor residing on the external face of the enterocyte luminal membrane. Glucose binds to the sensor and generates an intracellular signal leading to enhancement in the expression of SGLT1. The generated signal is independent of glucose metabolism and is likely to operate via a G-protein-coupled receptor and cAMP/protein kinase A signalling cascade.},

The present study tested the hypothesis that Na(+)-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-3, a member of the SGLT family of transport proteins, is involved in detection of luminal glucose in the intestine. Gastric emptying, measured in awake rats, was significantly inhibited by perfusion of the intestine with glucose (60 and 90 mg); this effect was mimicked by alpha-methyl glucose (nonmetabolizable substrate of SGLT-1 and -3) but not 2-deoxy-d-glucose (substrate for GLUT-2) or isoosmotic mannitol. Gastric motility and intestinal fluid secretion, measured in anesthetised rats, were significantly inhibited and stimulated, respectively, by duodenal glucose but not galactose, which has a much lower affinity for SGLT-3 than glucose. Duodenal glucose but not galactose stimulated the release of 5-HT into mesenteric lymph and stimulated the discharge of duodenal vagal afferent fibers. mRNA for SGLT-3 was identified in the duodenal mucosa. Together these data suggest that detection of glucose in the intestine may involve SGLT-3, possibly expressed by enterochromaffin cells in the intestinal mucosa, and release of 5-HT.},

abstract = {The glucose transporter isoform GLUT2 is expressed in liver, intestine, kidney and pancreatic islet beta cells, as well as in the central nervous system, in neurons, astrocytes and tanycytes. Physiological studies of genetically modified mice have revealed a role for GLUT2 in several regulatory mechanisms. In pancreatic beta cells, GLUT2 is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In hepatocytes, suppression of GLUT2 expression revealed the existence of an unsuspected glucose output pathway that may depend on a membrane traffic-dependent mechanism. GLUT2 expression is nevertheless required for the physiological control of glucose-sensitive genes, and its inactivation in the liver leads to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, revealing a liver-beta cell axis, which is likely to be dependent on bile acids controlling beta cell secretion capacity. In the nervous system, GLUT2-dependent glucose sensing controls feeding, thermoregulation and pancreatic islet cell mass and function, as well as sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. Electrophysiological and optogenetic techniques established that Glut2 (also known as Slc2a2)-expressing neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius can be activated by hypoglycaemia to stimulate glucagon secretion. In humans, inactivating mutations in GLUT2 cause Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, which is characterised by hepatomegaly and kidney disease; defects in insulin secretion are rare in adult patients, but GLUT2 mutations cause transient neonatal diabetes. Genome-wide association studies have reported that GLUT2 variants increase the risks of fasting hyperglycaemia, transition to type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and cardiovascular diseases. Individuals with a missense mutation in GLUT2 show preference for sugar-containing foods. We will discuss how studies in mice help interpret the role of GLUT2 in human physiology.},

abstract = {The landmark discovery by Bayliss and Starling in 1902 of the first hormone, secretin, emerged from earlier observations that a response (pancreatic secretion) following a stimulus (intestinal acidification) occurred after section of the relevant afferent nerve pathway. Nearly 80 years elapsed before it became clear that visceral afferent neurons could themselves also be targets for gut and other hormones. The action of gut hormones on vagal afferent neurons is now recognised to be an early step in controlling nutrient delivery to the intestine by regulating food intake and gastric emptying. Interest in these mechanisms has grown rapidly in view of the alarming global increase in obesity. Several of the gut hormones (cholecystokinin, CCK; PYY3-36; glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1) excite vagal afferent neurons to activate an ascending pathway leading to inhibition of food intake. Conversely others eg ghrelin, that are released in the inter-digestive period, inhibit vagal afferent neurons leading to increased food intake. Nutrient status determines the neurochemical phenotype of vagal afferent neurons by regulating a switch between states that promote orexigenic or anorexigenic signalling through mechanisms mediated, at least partly, by CCK. Gut-brain signalling is also influenced by leptin, by gut inflammation and by shifts in the gut microbiota including those that occur in obesity. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that diet-induced obesity locks the phenotype of vagal afferent neurons in a state similar to that normally occurring during fasting. Vagal afferent neurons are therefore early integrators of peripheral signals underling homeostatic mechanisms controlling nutrient intake. They may also provide new targets in developing treatments for obesity and feeding disorders.},

The need for additional structural components was evaluated. The model was evaluated by simulation and a bootstrap. Multiple glucose and insulin concentration peaks were observed in most individuals as well as hypoglycemic episodes in the second half of the experiment. The OGTT data were successfully described by the extended basic model. An additional control mechanism of insulin on glucose production improved the description of the data.

AIM To investigate the effect of testing protocol, gender, age and study country on regional GI transit times and associated pH values using the WMC. METHODS Regional GI transit times and pH values were determined in 215 healthy volunteers from USA and Sweden studied using the WMC over a 6.5-year period. The effects of test protocol, gender, age and study country were examined. RESULTS For GI transit times, testing protocol was associated with differences in gastric emptying time (GET; shorter with protocol 2 (motility capsule ingested immediately after meal) vs. protocol 1 (motility capsule immediately before): median difference: 52 min, P = 0.0063) and colonic transit time (CTT; longer with protocol 2: median 140 min, P = 0.0189), but had no overall effect on whole gut transit time. Females had longer GET (by median 17 min, P = 0.0307), and also longer CTT by (104 min, P = 0.0285) and whole gut transit time by (263 min, P = 0.0077). Increasing age was associated with shorter small bowel transit time (P = 0.002), and study country also influenced small bowel and CTTs. Whole gut and CTTs showed clustering of data at values separated by 24 h, suggesting that describing these measures as continuous variables is invalid. Testing protocol, gender and study country also significantly influenced pH values. CONCLUSIONS Regional GI transit times and pH values, delineated using the wireless motility capsule (WMC), vary based on testing protocol, gender, age and country.

abstract = {Saline (0.9{\%} NaCl) empties rapidly and exponentially from the stomach of the rhesus monkey, but glucose solutions empty at a calorie-constant rate of 0.4 kcal/min. By means of indwelling intragastric and intraduodenal cannulae we can demonstrate an inhibition on the delivery of saline from the stomach provoked by glucose placed beyond the pylorus. The inhibition varies directly with the glucose calories in the intestine and averages 2.5 min/kcal. That these two results (0.4 kcal/min and 2.5 min/kcal) are reciprocals suggests a feedback inhibition on the gastric emptying of nutrients arising from beyond the pylorus and adequate to explain the rate of glucose delivery to the intestine. A control theory description of gastric emptying that includes such feedback regulation can be derived from these data to explain the different gastric emptying patterns of nutrients and nonnutrient solutions. These patterns give this visceral system a precision in its management of nutrients that can provide information crucial to preabsorptive satiety.},

Men and women also differ in their response to drug treatment. It is therefore essential to understand these reactions in order to appropriately conduct risk assessment and to design safe and effective treatments. Even from that modest perspective, how and when we use drugs can result in unwanted and unexpected outcomes. This review summarizes the sex-based differences that impact on pharmacokinetics, and includes a general comparison of clinical pharmacology as it applies to men, women and pregnant women. Sex-related or pregnancy-induced changes in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination, when significant, may guide changes in dosage regimen or therapeutic monitoring to increase its effectiveness or reduce potential toxicity. Given those parameters, and our knowledge of sex differences, we can derive essentially all factors necessary for therapeutic optimization. Since this is a rapidly evolving area, it is essential for the practitioner to review drug prescribing information and recent literature in order to fully understand the impact of these differences on clinical therapeutics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Available insulin sensitivity (IS) methods based on the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are empirical. We used a glucose-insulin model to derive an OGTT-based IS (oral glucose insulin sensitivity [OGIS]) index, which predicts glucose clearance in a glucose clamp. We validated OGIS against clamp data. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS OGIS requires glucose and insulin concentrations from a 75-g OGTT at 0, 2, and 3 h (3-h OGTT) or at 0, 1.5, and 2 h (2-h OGTT). The formula includes six constants optimized to match the clamp results. For this purpose, 15 lean nondiabetic subjects (BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m2), 38 obese nondiabetic subjects (BMI {\textgreater} 25 kg/m2), and 38 subjects with type 2 diabetes randomly underwent an OGTT and a 120 mU x min(-1) x m(-2) insulin infusion euglycemic clamp. Glucose clearance (Cl CLAMP), calculated as the ratio of glucose infusion to concentration during the last hour of the clamp, was compared with OGIS. OGIS was also tested on an independent group of 13 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). RESULTS OGIS and Cl CLAMP were correlated in the whole group (R = 0.77, P {\textless} 0.0001), in the subgroups (lean: R = 0.59; obese: R = 0.73; type 2 diabetes: R = 0.49; P {\textless} 0.02), and in the independent IGT group (R = 0.65, P {\textless} 0.02). Reproducibility of OGIS and Cl CLAMP were similar (coefficients of variation: OGIS 7.1{\%}, Cl CLAMP 6.4{\%}). OGIS was as effective as Cl CLAMP in discriminating between groups (for OGIS, lean vs. obese: 440 +/- 16 vs. 362 +/- 11 ml x min(-1) x m(-2), p {\textless} 0.001; lean vs. type 2 diabetes: 440 +/- 16 vs. 239 +/- 7, P {\textless} 0.0001; obese vs. type 2 diabetes: 362 +/- 11 vs. 239 +/- 7, P {\textless} 0.0001; results were similar for Cl CLAMP). The relationships between IS and BMI, fasting plasma insulin, and insulin secretion (calculated from the OGTT insulin concentration) were examined. OGIS yielded results similar to Cl CLAMP and fully consistent with established physiological principles. The performance of the index for the 3-h and 2-h OGTT was similar. CONCLUSIONS OGIS is an index of IS in good agreement with the clamp. Because of its simplicity (only three blood samples required), this method has potential use for clinical investigation including large-scale epidemiological studies.},

abstract = {The gastric emptying characteristics of physiological saline (0.9{\%} NaCl) and glucose solutions of three different concentrations (0.05, 0.125, 0.25 g/ml) were examined in order to identify distinctions in the control of the stomach's activity. Saline emptied rapidly and exponentially. Glucose assumed, soon after filling the stomach, a slow and calorie-constant emptying pattern such that 2.13 kcal of glucose were delivered per minute to the duodenum for all three concentrations of glucose. When, by means of a catheter passed beyond the pylorus, glucose was infused into the duodenum in amounts varying from 26.5 to 120 kcal, an inhibition on the gastric emptying of physiological saline of 0.46 min/kcal of intraduodenal glucose was demonstrated. Since 2.13 kcallmin and 0.46 min/kcal are reciprocals, it appeared that in emptying saline, the gastroduodenal system acts as an “open-loop” system passing liquids from the stomach at a rate primarily determined by the volume of gastric contents. With glucose, however, a “closed-loop” system is established that assumes a steady-state balance between the delivery of glucose to the duodenum and the inhibition of this delivery evoked from the duodenum by the glucose that enters it. {\textcopyright} 1983, American Gastroenterological Association.

Fifteen normal weight male subjects aged 20-53 yr (mean 30 yr) and 15 normal weight female subjects aged 20-45 yr (mean 32 yr) were studied. Each subject ingested an identical 300-g meal consisting of 150 g of beef stew and 150 g of orange juice. Technetium-99m-(99mTc) labeled liver pate was used as the radioactive marker for the solid phase; indium-111 DTPA [( 111In]DTPA) was the liquid marker. A scintillation camera and computer was used to measure the rate of emptying of the solid and liquid phases. Correction for radionuclide depth, decay, and crosstalk was performed. The half-emptying time for men was: solids 59.8 +/- 3.7 min, liquids 30.3 +/- 2.3 min, and for women was: solids 92.4 +/- 7.5 min, liquids 53.8 +/- 4.9 min. These differences were statistically significant (solids, p = 0.00097; liquids, p = 0.00038). We conclude that women empty both solids and liquids from their stomachs more slowly than men. Possible mechanisms for the difference in gastric emptying rates between men and women are discussed.},

abstract = {A new mathematical model of short-term glucose regulation by insulin is proposed to exploit the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is commonly used for clinical diagnosis of glucose intolerance and diabetes. Contributions of endogenous and exogenous sources to measured plasma glucose concentrations have been separated by means of additional oral administration and constant intravenous infusion of glucose labeled with two different tracers. Twelve type 2 diabetic patients (7 males and 5 females) and 10 control subjects (5 males and 5 females) with normal glucose tolerance and matched body mass index (BMI) participated in this study. Blood samples for measurement of concentrations/activity of unlabeled and double-tracer glucose and insulin were collected every 15 min for 3 h following the oral glucose load. A minimal model combined with non-linear mixed-effects population parameter estimation has been devised to characterize group-average and between-patient variability of: (i) gastrointestinal glucose absorption; (ii) endogenous glucose production (EGP), and (iii) glucose disposal rate. Results indicate that insulin-independent glucose clearance does not vary significantly with gender or diabetic state and that the latter strongly affects, as expected, insulin-dependent clearance (insulin sensitivity). Inhibition of EGP, interpreted in terms of variations from basal of insulin concentrations, does not appear to be affected by diabetes but rather by BMI, i.e. by the degree of obesity. This study supports the utility of a minimal modelling approach, combined with population parameter estimation, to characterize glucose absorption, production and disposition during double-tracer OGTT experiments. The model provides a means for planning further experiments to validate the new hypothesis on the influence of individual factors, such as BMI and diabetes, on glucose appearance and disappearance, and for designing new simplified clinical tests. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Beginning at week-2 after insertion, the animals were either fasted for 24 h or fed a liquid meal 2-3 h before the experiment. With the animals fully conscious, a polyethylene bag was inserted into the proximal stomach through the gastrocutaneous fistula, followed by 15 min of air inflation (minimal distending pressure of ＋2 mmHg) and then 20 mL of a low-, mid- or high-concentration triacetin solution (0.5{\%}, 1.0{\%} and 2.0{\%}) or warm water (vehicle control). The proximal stomach receptive volume and gastric antral and duodenal contractions were measured over 10 min. The experiment was repeated twice per week over several months, with each animal receiving at least one infusion of the various triacetin solutions and the vehicle at different times. Intergroup differences were assessed by ANOVA and Bonferroni-Dunn post-hoc testing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Intra-gastric infusion of mid- and high-concentration triacetin induced an increase in the proximal stomach receptive volume, and the average increase induced by the high-concentration at 0-4 min after infusion was significantly greater than that induced by the vehicle control (62.4 ± 9.8 vs 18.4 ± 4.7, P {\textless} 0.01).

The 150-ml glucose meals (0.05, 0.125, and 0.25 g/ml) emptied more slowly than saline, progressively more slowly with increasing concentrations (0.05--1.8, 0.125--0.78, and 0.25--0.37 ml/min) and linearly through most of their course. Doubling the volume of 0.125 g/ml-glucose meal did not change the rate of emptying. Converting grams of glucose to their caloric content, the emptying rate in kcal/min becomes constant (approx 0.4 kcal/min) in this range of concentrations. Isocaloric casein hydrolysate and medium-chain triglyceride oil meals at 0.5 kcal/ml empty at the same rate as glucose. The precision of this regulation is sufficient to give it a role in preabsorptive satiety and the control of caloric intake.},

Little information is available on the location of this inhibitory mechanism or on the relative contribution of titratable acidity and pH to this feedback control. We hypothesized that the dependence on titratable acidity is related to the length of the intestine exposed to acid and that the dependence on pH is related to the region of the intestine exposed to acid. To test these ideas, we studied 11 dogs with duodenal and jejunal fistulas. The inhibitory effects were tested when different lengths of the small intestine were exposed to test solutions of 0.03, 0.06, and 0.12 meq/ml titratable acidities. pH as an independent covariable was separated from titratable acidity by comparing the inhibition of gastric emptying of lactic acid (pH fixed to 2.4) to HCl (pH 0.96-1.6). Maximal inhibition of gastric emptying by both acids depended on acid exposure of a length of small intestine that was greater than 65 but less than or equal to 150 cm long. When acid was confined to the proximal 15 cm, increasing concentration of HCl (decreasing pH) resulted in increasing inhibition, but this effect was absent with increasing concentration of lactic acid (fixed pH). Inhibition was absent when 0.06 meq/ml HCl was infused into the intestine beyond the midintestine.},

abstract = {Models have been developed to explain double-peaked plasma concentration-time profiles using mechanisms such as variable absorption and enterohepatic recirculation. Interruption of gastric emptying has also been shown to produce double-peaks, and this work proposes models for analysis of such data. In the presence of levodopa, gastric emptying is interrupted at times associated with double-peaks in pharmacokinetic profiles. Data from a simultaneous scintigraphy and paracetamol absorption study with levodopa was obtained, and models with compartments for stomach, intestine, central and peripheral tissue were developed to describe levodopa and paracetamol pharmacokinetics, including the double-peak phenomenon. The empirical model uses two gastric emptying parameter rates which are applied over separate time periods to describe the varying gastric emptying rate. The semi-mechanistic model uses a feedback mechanism acting via an effect compartment to link the plasma concentration of levodopa to the rate of gastric emptying, allowing levodopa pharmacokinetics to vary the rate of gastric emptying and give rise to a multiple-peaked plasma pharmacokinetic profile. The models were applied to plasma levodopa and paracetamol pharmacokinetic data with and without simultaneous analysis of scintigraphy data, in both cases giving a good fit and in the absence of scintigraphy data adequately predicting the stomach profile. For the semi-mechanistic model, the first-order constant governing gastric emptying was shown to switch between fast and slow values at a critical levodopa effect compartment concentration. New models have thus been proposed for analysis of plasma concentration profiles that exhibit double-peak phenomenon and applied successfully to levodopa data.},

abstract = {AIMS: To quantify the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, on renal glucose reabsorption in patients with type 2 diabetes, and to evaluate covariate effects, using a mechanistic population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model. METHODS: Four phase I/II trials were used for model development. Empagliflozin's PK characteristics were characterized by a two-compartmental model with sequential zero- and first-order absorption. Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) was described as dependent on renal glucose filtration and reabsorption; splay of the glucose reabsorption/excretion curves was considered. The modelling assumed that empagliflozin lowers the maximum renal glucose reabsorption capacity and, thereby, the renal threshold for glucose (RTg). Covariate effects were investigated using a full covariate modelling approach, emphasizing parameter estimation. RESULTS: The PK-PD model provided a reasonable description of the PK characteristics of empagliflozin and its effects on UGE across a range of renal function levels. Its parameters are consistent with reported values for renal physiology. Using this model, the effect of empagliflozin on renal glucose reabsorption was quantified. Steady-state empagliflozin doses (1, 5, 10 and 25 mg) reduced RTg from 12.5 mmol/L [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 12.0, 13.1] to 5.66 (95{\%} CI 4.62, 6.72), 3.01 (95{\%} CI 2.33, 3.69), 2.53 (95{\%} CI 1.83, 3.14) and 2.21 (95{\%} CI 1.47, 2.84) mg/dl, respectively. Covariate analysis showed the effect of empagliflozin on UGE was not influenced, to a clinically relevant extent, by sex, age or race. CONCLUSIONS: A method for characterizing renal glucose reabsorption was developed that does not require complex glucose clamp experiments. These analyses indicate that empagliflozin provided concentration-dependent RTg reductions, with 10 and 25 mg providing near-maximum RTg-lowering.},

abstract = {Renal elimination and the resulting clearance of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from the serum exhibit pronounced sex differences in the adult rat. The literature suggests that this is largely due to hormonally regulated expression of organic anion transporters (OATs) on the apical and basolateral membranes of the proximal tubule cells that facilitate excretion and reabsorption of PFOA from the filtrate into the blood. Previously developed PBPK models of PFOA exposure in the rat have not been parameterized to specifically account for transporter-mediated renal elimination. We developed a PBPK model for PFOA in male and female rats to explore the role of Oat1, Oat3, and Oatp1a1 in sex-specific renal reabsorption and excretion of PFOA. Descriptions of the kinetic behavior of these transporters were extrapolated from in vitro studies and the model was used to simulate time-course serum, liver, and urine data for intravenous (IV) and oral exposures in both sexes. Model predicted concentrations of PFOA in the liver, serum, and urine showed good agreement with experimental data for both male and female rats indicating that in vitro derived physiological descriptions of transporter-mediated renal reabsorption can successfully predict sex-dependent excretion of PFOA in the rat. This study supports the hypothesis that sex-specific serum half-lives for PFOA are largely driven by expression of transporters in the kidney and contribute to the development of PBPK modeling as a tool for evaluating the role of transporters in renal clearance.},

abstract = {The gastric emptying characteristics of physiological saline (0.9{\%} NaCl) and glucose solutions of three different concentrations (0.05, 0.125, 0.25 g/ml) were examined in order to identify distinctions in the control of the stomach's activity. Saline emptied rapidly and exponentially. Glucose assumed, soon after filling the stomach, a slow and calorie-constant emptying pattern such that 2.13 kcal of glucose were delivered per minute to the duodenum for all three concentrations of glucose. When, by means of a catheter passed beyond the pylorus, glucose was infused into the duodenum in amounts varying from 26.5 to 120 kcal, an inhibition on the gastric emptying of physiological saline of 0.46 min/kcal of intraduodenal glucose was demonstrated. Since 2.13 kcallmin and 0.46 min/kcal are reciprocals, it appeared that in emptying saline, the gastroduodenal system acts as an “open-loop” system passing liquids from the stomach at a rate primarily determined by the volume of gastric contents. With glucose, however, a “closed-loop” system is established that assumes a steady-state balance between the delivery of glucose to the duodenum and the inhibition of this delivery evoked from the duodenum by the glucose that enters it. {\textcopyright} 1983, American Gastroenterological Association.

Model extensions comprised the description of glucose absorption by a chain of transit compartments with a mean transit time of 35 minutes, a bioavailability of 80{\%}, and a representation of the incretin effect, expressed as a direct effect of the glucose absorption rate on insulin secre-tion. The ability of the model to predict the incretin effect was assessed by simulating the observed difference in insulin response following an oral glucose tolerance test compared with an isoglycemic glucose infusion mimicking an oral glucose tolerance test profile.

abstract = {Intestinal glucose absorption is mediated by SGLT1 whereas GLUT2 is considered to provide basolateral exit. Recently, it was proposed that GLUT2 can be recruited into the apical membrane after a high luminal glucose bolus allowing bulk absorption of glucose by facilitated diffusion. Moreover, SGLT1 and GLUT2 are suggested to play an important role in intestinal glucose sensing and incretin secretion. In mice that lack either SGLT1 or GLUT2 we re-assessed the role of these transporters in intestinal glucose uptake after radiotracer glucose gavage and performed Western blot analysis for transporter abundance in apical membrane fractions in a comparative approach. Moreover, we examined the contribution of these transporters to glucose-induced changes in plasma GIP, GLP-1 and insulin levels. In mice lacking SGLT1, tissue retention of tracer glucose was drastically reduced throughout the entire small intestine whereas GLUT2-deficient animals exhibited higher tracer contents in tissue samples than wild type animals. Deletion of SGLT1 resulted also in reduced blood glucose elevations and abolished GIP and GLP-1 secretion in response to glucose. In mice lacking GLUT2, glucose-induced insulin but not incretin secretion was impaired. Western blot analysis revealed unchanged protein levels of SGLT1 after glucose gavage. GLUT2 detected in apical membrane fractions mainly resulted from contamination with basolateral membranes but did not change in density after glucose administration. SGLT1 is unequivocally the prime intestinal glucose transporter even at high luminal glucose concentrations. Moreover, SGLT1 mediates glucose-induced incretin secretion. Our studies do not provide evidence for GLUT2 playing any role in either apical glucose influx or incretin secretion.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) show reduced insulin sensitivity and markedly elevated glucose excursions. After delivery, GDM mostly reverts to normal glucose tolerance (NGT), although leaving an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Because gastrointestinal function changes during pregnancy causing vomiting, constipation, or reduced motility, we thought that gut glucose absorption in GDM or pregnancy might be altered to affect circulating glucose excursions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS By undergoing 180-min oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), pregnant women with GDM (GDMpreg; n=15, BMI=32±2 kg/m2, aged 33±1 years) were compared with NGT women (NGTpreg; n=7, BMI=28±1 kg/m2, aged 34±2 years), matching for major anthropometric characteristics (each P{\textgreater}0.2). After delivery (6-7 months later), both groups were studied the same way. We computed and mathematically modeled gut glucose absorption from insulin-mediated glucose disappearance and endogenous glucose production (EGP). Whole-body insulin sensitivity was calculated using the Clamp-like Index. RESULTS GDMpreg showed 16-25{\%} higher plasma glucose concentrations (P{\textless}0.04) during the final 2 h of OGTT, similar EGP, but lower (P{\textless}0.01) insulin sensitivity (2.7±0.2 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1){\textperiodcentered}min(-1) vs. NGTpreg: 4.5±0.8 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1){\textperiodcentered}min(-1)). In GDMpreg, gut glucose absorption rates were ≤52{\%} lower from 30 to 120 min (P{\textless}0.03 vs. conditions after delivery or NGTpreg). In contrast, glucose absorption rates in NGTpreg were comparable during and after pregnancy. None of the studied women developed diabetes after delivery. CONCLUSIONS In GDMpreg, OGTT gut glucose absorption is markedly lower during hyperglycemia, whereas both glycemia and glucose absorption in NGTpreg are comparable between pregnant and postpartum states. Thus, hyperglycemia in GDM does not seem to result from too rapid or increased glucose absorption.},

abstract = {The rate of appearance (R(a)) of exogenous glucose in plasma after glucose ingestion is presently measured by tracer techniques that cannot be used in standard clinical testing such as the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We propose a mathematical model that represents in a simple way the gastric emptying, the transport of glucose along the intestinal tract, and its absorption from gut lumen into portal blood. The model gives the R(a) time course in terms of parameters with a physiological counterpart and provides an expression for the release of incretin hormones as related to glucose transit into gut lumen. Glucose absorption was represented by assuming two components related to a proximal and a distal transporter. Model performance was evaluated by numerical simulations. The model was then validated by fitting OGTT glucose and GLP-1 data in healthy controls and type 2 diabetic patients, and useful information was obtained for the rate of gastric emptying, the rate of glucose absorption, the R(a) profile, the insulin sensitivity, and the glucose effectiveness. Model-derived estimates of insulin sensitivity were well correlated (r = 0.929 in controls and 0.886 in diabetic patients) to data obtained from the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Although the proposed OGTT analysis requires the measurement of an additional hormone concentration (GLP-1), it appears to be a reasonable choice since it avoids complex and expensive techniques, such as isotopes for glucose R(a) measurement and direct assessment of gastric emptying and intestinal transit, and gives additional correlated information, thus largely compensating for the extra expense.},

abstract = {Recently, a new approach has been proposed to estimate insulin sensitivity (S(I)) from an oral glucose tolerance test or a meal using an "integral equation". Here, we improve on the "integral equation" by resorting to a "differential equation" approach. The classic glucose kinetics minimal model was used with the addition of a parametric model for the rate of appearance into plasma of oral glucose (Ra). Three behavioral models of Ra were proposed: piecewise-linear (P), spline (S) and dynamic (D). All three models performed satisfactorily allowing a precise estimation of S(I) and a plausible reconstruction of Ra. Mean S(I) estimates were virtually identical: S(I)P = 6.81 +/- 0.87 (SE); S(I)S = 6.53 +/- 0.80; and S(I)D = 6.62 +/- 0.79. S(I) strongly correlated with the integral-equation index (I) S(I)I: r = 0.99, p {\textless} 0.01 for models D and S, and r 0.97, p {\textless} 0.01 for P. Also, SI compared well with insulin sensitivity estimated from intravenous glucose tolerance test in the same subjects (r = 0.75, p {\textless} 0.01; r = 0.71, p {\textless} 0.01; r = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.01, respectively, for P, S, and D models versus s(I)IVGTT). Finally, the novel approach allows estimation of SI from a shorter test (120 min): model P yielded S(I)R = 7.16 +/- 1.0 (R for reduced) which correlated very well with S(I)P and S(I)I (respectively, r = 0.94, p {\textless} 0.01; r = 0.95, p {\textless} 0.01) and still satisfactorily with S(I)IVGTT (r = 0.77, p {\textless} 0.01).},

The aim of this work was to use knowledge of physiology to improve the IGI model's description of glucose absorption and gastric emptying after tests with varying glucose doses. The developed model's performance was compared to empirical models. To develop our model, data from oral and intravenous glucose challenges in patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy control subjects were used together with present knowledge of small intestinal transit time, glucose inhibition of gastric emptying, and saturable absorption of glucose over the epithelium to improve the description of gastric emptying and glucose absorption in the IGI model. Duodenal glucose was found to inhibit gastric emptying. The performance of the saturable glucose absorption was superior to linear absorption regardless of the gastric emptying model applied. The semiphysiological model developed performed better than previously published empirical models and allows better understanding of the mechanisms underlying glucose absorption. In conclusion, our new model provides a better description and improves the understanding of dynamic glucose tests involving oral glucose.$\backslash$n},

However, there is no strategy for analyzing segmental Pi absorption from a spontaneously propelled meal in an intact animal. We propose a solution using compartmental analysis. After intragastric administration of a 32P-labeled Pi liquid meal containing a nonabsorbable marker, [14C]polyethylene glycol (PEG), rats were killed at 2, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min. The gastrointestinal tract was removed and divided into seven segments, from which 32P and [14C]PEG were recovered. Data was expressed as a percentage of the dose fed, i.e., (32P[in segment] divided by 32P[fed]) and [14C]PEG[in segment] divided by [14C]PEG[fed]), respectively. A compartmental model was constructed and the rate constants for intersegmental transit and segmental absorption were estimated. The "goodness of fit" between the simulated model and the actual data indicates the estimated rate constants reflect in vivo events. The duodenum, with the highest transit and absorption rates, accounted for a third of the total absorption. However, the terminal ileum, with a lower absorption rate but a longer transit time, absorbed an equal amount of Pi. This approach allows the analysis of the mechanism and the regulation of Pi absorption under more authentic in vivo conditions.},

On consecutive days, subjects ate liquidized meals containing 20 or 60 g starch; ileal aspirates were analyzed for starch and glucose for 5-6 h fasting and 4-7 h postprandially. Volume and carbohydrate concentrations were used to derive total carbohydrate traversing the ileum. In different subjects, unabsorbed carbohydrate was 453-4023 mg (2.3{\%}-20.1{\%}, mean 9.3{\%}) for the smaller meal and 1332-6352 mg (2.2{\%}-10.4{\%}, mean 6.0{\%}) for the larger. In 4 volunteers, hydrogen breath tests were performed on separate occasions after sucrose (50 g), lactulose (26 g), and the 20-g meal.

abstract = {Over the last decade, a debate has developed about the mechanism of the passive or 'diffusive' component of intestinal glucose absorption and, indeed, whether it even exists. Pappenheimer and colleagues have proposed that paracellular solvent drag contributes a passive component, which, at high concentrations of sugars similar to those in the jejunal lumen immediately after a meal, is severalfold greater than the active component mediated by the Na+-glucose cotransporter SGLT1. On the other hand, Ferraris {\&} Diamond maintain that the kinetics of glucose absorption can be explained solely in terms of SGLT1 and that a passive or paracellular component plays little, if any, part. Recently, we have provided new evidence that the passive component of glucose absorption exists, but is in fact facilitated since it is mediated by the rapid, glucose-dependent activation and recruitment of the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT2 to the brush-border membrane; regulation involves a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway activated by glucose transport through SGLT1 and also involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signalling pathways. This topical review seeks to highlight the significant points of the debate, to show how our proposals on GLUT2 impact on different aspects of the debate and to look at the regulatory events that are likely to be involved in the short-term regulation of sugar absorption during the assimilation of a meal.},

Gut glucose half-life was markedly higher in females (79 ± 2 min) than in males (65 ± 3 min, P {\textless} 0.0001) and negatively related to body height (r = -0.481; P {\textless} 0.0001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study in healthy, glucose-tolerant humans shows for the first time different ABS rates during OGTT in women and men and a negative relationship between body height and gut glucose half-life. Prolonged ABS in females might therefore contribute to higher plasma glucose concentrations at the end of OGTT.},

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a major health risk in many countries, and the incidence rates are increasing. Diverse therapeutic agents are applied to treat this condition. Since 1960, numerous mathematical models have been developed to describe the glucose-insulin system, analyse data from diagnostic tests and quantify drug effects. This review summarizes the present state-of-the-art in diabetes modelling, with a focus on models describing drug effects, and identifies major strengths and limitations of the published models. For diagnostic purposes, the minimal model has remained the most popular choice for several decades, and numerous extensions have been developed. Use of the minimal model is limited for applications other than diagnostic tests. More mechanistic models that include glucose-insulin feedback in both directions have been applied. The use of biophase distribution models for the description of drug effects is not always appropriate. More recently, the effects of various antidiabetic agents on glucose and insulin have been modelled with indirect response models. Such models provide good curve fits and mechanistic descriptions of the effects of antidiabetic drugs on glucose-insulin homeostasis. These and other types of models were used to describe secondary drug effects on glucose and insulin, and effects on ancillary biomarkers. Modelling of disease progression in diabetes can utilize indirect response models as a disturbance of homeostasis. Future needs are to include glucose-insulin feedback more often, develop mechanistic models for new drug groups, consider dual drug effects on complementary subsystems, and incorporate elements of disease progression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We studied whether patterns of glucose absorption during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were abnormal in individuals with impaired glucose regulation and whether they were related to sex and body size (height and fat-free mass). We also examined how well differences in insulin sensitivity and $\beta$-cell function measured by gold-standard tests were reflected in the corresponding OGTT-derived estimates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: With validated methods, various aspects of glucose absorption were estimated from 12-point, 3-h, 75-g OGTTs in 66 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), isolated impaired fasting glucose (i-IFG), or isolated impaired glucose tolerance (i-IGT). Insulin sensitivity and $\beta$-cell function were measured with the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and intravenous glucose tolerance tests, respectively. Surrogate markers of both conditions were calculated from OGTTs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: More rapid glucose absorption (P ≤ 0.036) and reduced late glucose absorption (P ≤ 0.039) were observed in the i-IFG group relative to NGT and i-IGT groups. Women with i-IGT had a lower early glucose absorption than did men with i-IGT (P = 0.041); however, this difference did not persist when differences in body size were taken into account (P {\textgreater} 0.28). Faster glucose absorption was related to higher fasting (P = 0.001) and lower 2-h (P = 0.001) glucose levels and to greater height and fat-free mass (P {\textless} 0.001). All OGTT-derived measures of insulin sensitivity, but only one of three measures of $\beta$-cell function, reflected the differences for these parameters between those with normal and impaired glucose regulation as measured by gold-standard tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Glucose absorption patterns during an OGTT are significantly related to plasma glucose levels and body size, which should be taken into account when estimating $\beta$-cell function from OGTTs in epidemiological studies.},

abstract = {Models of glucose metabolism are a valuable tool for fundamental and applied medical research in diabetes. Use cases range from pharmaceutical target selection to automatic blood glucose control. Standard compartmental models represent little biological detail, which hampers the integration of multiscale data and confines predictive capabilities. We developed a detailed, generic physiologically based whole-body model of the glucose-insulin-glucagon regulatory system, reflecting detailed physiological properties of healthy populations and type 1 diabetes individuals expressed in the respective parameterizations. The model features a detailed representation of absorption models for oral glucose, subcutaneous insulin and glucagon, and an insulin receptor model relating pharmacokinetic properties to pharmacodynamic effects. Model development and validation is based on literature data. The quality of predictions is high and captures relevant observed inter- and intra-individual variability. In the generic form, the model can be applied to the development and validation of novel diabetes treatment strategies.CPT: Pharmacometrics {\&} Systems Pharmacology (2013) 2, e65; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.40; published online 14 August 2013.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease, which affects millions of people worldwide. The disease is characterized by chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations (hyperglycaemia), which result in comorbidities and multi-organ dysfunction. This is due to a gradual loss of glycaemic control as a result of increasing insulin resistance, as well as decreasing $\beta$-cell function. The objective of T2DM drug interventions is, therefore, to reduce fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations to normal, healthy levels without hypoglycaemia. Several classes of novel antihyperglycaemic drugs with various mechanisms of action have been developed over the past decades or are currently under clinical development. The development of these drugs is routinely supported by the application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation approaches. They integrate information on the drug's pharmacokinetics, clinically relevant biomarker information and disease progression into a single, unifying approach, which can be used to inform clinical study design, dose selection and drug labelling. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the quantitative approaches that have been reported since the 2008 review by Landersdorfer and Jusko in an increasing order of complexity, starting with glucose homeostasis models. Each of the presented approaches is discussed with respect to its strengths and limitations, and respective knowledge gaps are highlighted as potential opportunities for future drug--disease model development in the area of T2DM.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Rapid achievement of dermal anesthesia in pediatric practice without discomfort is both desirable and difficult. The Northstar Iontophoretic Drug Delivery System (IDDS) is designed to achieve this objective in 10 minutes using a current of 1.78 mA, compared with the 40 to 60 minutes required for traditional percutaneous methods (eg, eutectic mixture of local anesthetics or EMLA cream). For evaluating the tolerance of this IDDS in pediatrics, 12 healthy children (5-15 years, 4 girls and 8 boys, 10 white, weight 19-79 kg) were evaluated. METHODS: An open-label trial with random applications of IDDS containing lidocaine (100 mg of 10{\%}) and epinephrine (1.05 mg of 1:10,000) to 3 of the 4 possible sites (back, chest, dorsum of hand, and antecubital fossa) was conducted. Three successive applications (time = 0, 3 hours and 3.5 hours) were performed in each subject, with repeated blood sampling (n = 12 over 10 hours) for assessment of plasma lidocaine concentrations. Skin evaluation (by Draize scoring) at both anode and cathode sites was performed at 10 and 24 hours. RESULTS: Few of the subjects (0{\%}-28{\%}) experienced any dermal abnormalities at 10 hours. These findings were maintained at the 24-hour follow-up evaluation with the vast majority of subjects (92{\%}-100{\%}) having no evidence of erythema or edema irrespective of application site. Erythema associated with the anode seemed to be more prominent when the study device was applied to either the chest or the back as compared with the antecubital fossa or dorsum of the hand. No subjects complained of pain/discomfort associated with IDDS delivery. Plasma lidocaine levels in all subjects were below 10 ng/mL at all time points. CONCLUSIONS: The IDDS seems not to deliver a significant, systemic dose of lidocaine and to be well tolerated and potentially suitable for clinical use in pediatric subjects.},

abstract = {In typical nonlinear plasma protein binding (PPB) behavior, the free fraction increases with increasing total concentrations. In contrast, when a drug exhibits atypical nonlinear PPB behavior, the free fraction decreases with increasing total concentrations. Tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, exhibits atypical nonlinear PPB behavior, but the mechanism of such behavior is currently unknown. Because tigecycline can form complexes with metal ions, an interaction between metal ion, tigecycline, and plasma proteins was hypothesized but not further investigated. The current work explores the role of metal ions in the atypical nonlinear PPB behavior of tigecycline and proposes a plausible mechanism of atypical nonlinear PPB behavior. The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid resulted in 10- to 30-fold higher unbound fractions, and the atypical behavior was nullified. The saturation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid chelation, by addition of excessive divalent metal ions, such as calcium and magnesium, led to the return of the atypical nonlinear PPB behavior. Different possible mechanisms were evaluated by simulation, and a plausible mechanism was proposed.},

The RAD-ADAPT interface is written using the statistical software R and the underlying computations are accomplished by the ADAPT software system for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic systems analysis.

abstract = {The alarming increase of resistance against multiple currently available antibiotics is leading to a rapid lose of treatment options against infectious diseases. Since the antibiotic resistance is partially due to a misuse or abuse of the antibiotics, this situation can be reverted when improving their use. One strategy is the optimization of the antimicrobial dosing regimens. In fact, inappropriate drug choice and suboptimal dosing are two major factors that should be considered because they lead to the emergence of drug resistance and consequently, poorer clinical outcomes. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis in combination with Monte Carlo simulation allows to optimize dosing regimens of the antibiotic agents in order to conserve their therapeutic value. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explain the basis of the PK/PD analysis and associated techniques, and provide a brief revision of the applications of PK/PD analysis from a therapeutic point-of-view. The establishment and reevaluation of clinical breakpoints is the sticking point in antibiotic therapy as the clinical use of the antibiotics depends on them. Two methodologies are described to establish the PK/PD breakpoints, which are a big part of the clinical breakpoint setting machine. Furthermore, the main subpopulations of patients with altered characteristics that can condition the PK/PD behavior (such as critically ill, elderly, pediatric or obese patients) and therefore, the outcome of the antibiotic therapy, are reviewed. Finally, some recommendations are provided from a PK/PD point of view to enhance the efficacy of prophylaxis protocols used in surgery.},

abstract = {Bortezomib is a reversible proteasome inhibitor with potent antineoplastic activity that exhibits dose- and time-dependent pharmacokinetics (PK). Proteasome-mediated bortezomib disposition is proposed as the primary source of its nonlinear and apparent nonstationary PK behavior. Single intravenous (IV) doses of bortezomib (0.25 and 1 mg/kg) were administrated to BALB/c mice, with blood and tissue samples obtained over 144 h, which were analyzed by LC/MS/MS. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model incorporating tissue drug-target binding was developed to test the hypothesis of proteasome-mediated bortezomib disposition. The final model reasonably captured bortezomib plasma and tissue PK profiles, and parameters were estimated with good precision. The rank-order of model estimated tissue target density correlated well with experimentally measured proteasome concentrations reported in the literature, supporting the hypothesis that binding to proteasome influences bortezomib disposition. The PBPK model was further scaled-up to humans to assess the similarity of bortezomib disposition among species. Human plasma bortezomib PK profiles following multiple IV dosing (1.3 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 were simulated by appropriately scaling estimated mouse parameters. Simulated and observed bortezomib concentrations after multiple dosing were in good agreement, suggesting target-mediated bortezomib disposition is likely for both mice and humans. Furthermore, the model predicts that renal impairment should exert minimal influence on bortezomib exposure in humans, confirming that bortezomib dose adjustment is not necessary for patients with renal impairment.},

abstract = {FLT3(ITD) subtype acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has a poor prognosis with currently available therapies. A number of small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 and/or CDK4/6 are currently under development. A more complete and quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of action of FLT3 and CDK4/6 inhibitors may better inform the development of current and future compounds that act on one or both of the molecular targets, and thus may lead to improved treatments for AML. In this study, we investigated in both subcutaneous and orthotopic AML mouse models, the mechanisms of action of three FLT3 and/or CDK4/6 inhibitors: AMG925 (Amgen), sorafenib (Bayer and Onyx), and quizartinib (Ambit Biosciences). A composite model was developed to integrate the plasma pharmacokinetics of these three compounds on their respective molecular targets, the coupling between the target pathways, as well as the resulting effects on tumor burden reduction in the subcutaneous xenograft model. A sequential modeling approach was used, wherein model structures and estimated parameters from upstream processes (e.g. PK, cellular signaling) were fixed for modeling subsequent downstream processes (cellular signaling, tumor burden). Pooled data analysis was employed for the plasma PK and cellular signaling modeling, while population modeling was applied to the tumor burden modeling. The resulting model allows the decomposition of the relative contributions of FLT3(ITD) and CDK4/6 inhibition on downstream signaling and tumor burden. In addition, the action of AMG925 on cellular signaling and tumor burden was further studied in an orthotopic tumor mouse model more closely representing the physiologically relevant environment for AML.},

abstract = {Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting soluble inflammatory cytokines exert their pharmacological effects in rheumatoid arthritis through binding and neutralizing free cytokines in target tissue sites. Therefore suppression of free cytokines in such sites directly relates to the magnitude of therapeutic response. Although the interrelationships between mAb and cytokines have been examined in the systemic circulation, less is known about the interaction of mAb and cytokines in inflamed joints. In the present study, the interplay between the mAb, CNTO 345, and its target IL-6 in serum as well as ankle joint synovial fluid were characterized in collagen-induced arthritic mice. A minimal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model with target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) features in serum and ankle joint synovial fluid was developed for the assessment of the TMDD dynamics of CNTO 345 and IL-6. Our model indicates that TMDD kinetics in ankle joints differ greatly from that in serum. The differences can be attributed to the limited tissue distribution of CNTO 345 in ankle joint synovial fluid, the significant rise of the IL-6 baseline in ankle joint synovial fluid in comparison with serum, and the relative time-scales of elimination rates between CNTO 345, free IL-6 and CNTO 345-IL-6 complex in serum and ankle joint synovial fluid.},

abstract = {Target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) usually accounts for nonlinear pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs whose distribution and/or clearance are affected by their targets owing to high affinity and limited capacity. TMDD is frequently reported for monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for such reason. Minimal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (mPBPK), which accommodate the unique PK behaviors of mAb, provide a general approach for analyzing mAbs PK and predicting mAb interstitial concentrations in two groups of tissues. This study assessed the feasibility of incorporating TMDD into mPBPK models to consider target-binding in either plasma (cTMDD) or interstitial fluid (ISF) (pTMDD). The dose-related signature profiles of the pTMDD model reveal a parallel early decay phase, in contrast with the cTMDD model that exhibits a faster initial decline for low doses. The parallel early phase in the pTMDD model is associated with the slow perivascular extravasation of mAb, which restricts the initial decline regardless of interstitial target-mediated elimination. The cTMDD and pTMDD models both preserve the long terminal phase that is typically perceived in conventional two-compartment (2CM) and TMDD models. Having TMDD in ISF impacts the typical relationships between plasma concentrations and receptor occupancy, and between saturation of apparent nonlinear clearance and saturation of receptors. The vascular reflection coefficient ($\sigma$ v ) was found to affect receptor occupancy in ISF. In the cTMDD model, saturation of nonlinear clearance is equivalent to saturation of receptors. However, in the pTMDD model, they are no longer equal and all parameters pertaining to receptors or receptor binding (R total , K D , K ss , k int ) shifts such relationships. Different TMDD models were utilized in analyzing PK for seven mAbs from digitized literature data. When the target is in plasma, the cTMDD model performed similarly to the 2CM and TMDD models, but with one less system parameter. When the target exists in ISF, the pTMDD functioned well in analyzing only plasma data to reflect interstitial target binding properties. Assigning TMDD consistent with target-expressing tissues is important to obtain reliable characterizations of receptors and receptor binding. The mPBPK model exhibits excellent feasibility in integrating TMDD not only in plasma but also in ISF.},

abstract = {Minimal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) models provide a sensible modeling approach when fitting only plasma (or blood) data yielding physiologically-relevant PK parameters that may provide more practical value than parameters of mammillary models. We propose a second-generation mPBPK model specifically for monoclonal antibodies (mAb) by including (lumping) several essential components of mAb PK used in full PBPK models. These components include convection as the primary mechanism of antibody movement from plasma into tissues and return to plasma with interstitial fluid as the major extravascular distribution space. The model divides tissue spaces into two groups according to their vascular endothelial structure, leaky and tight, which consequently allows discernment of two types and general sites of distribution. This mPBPK model was applied to two mAbs in mice and ten mAbs with linear kinetics in humans. The model captured their plasma PK profiles well with predictions of concentrations in interstitial fluid for two types of tissues. Predictions of tissue concentrations for mAb 7E3 and 8C2 were consistent with actual measurements in mice, indicating the feasibility of this model in assessing extravascular distribution in the two categories of tissues. The vascular reflection coefficients ($\sigma$₁) of tight tissues (V(tight)) ranged 0.883-0.987 and coefficients ($\sigma$₂) for leaky tissues (V(leaky)) ranged 0.311 to 0.837. The plasma clearance (CL(p)) varied among the mAbs in humans from 0.0054 to 0.03 L/h. In addition, applying this model generates parameters for mAb transcapillary escape rates and assesses major sites of elimination. Four of ten mAbs exhibited better fitting statistics premised on elimination from interstitial fluid than from plasma. This approach allows comparisons of mAb PK when only plasma data are available, provides more realistic parameters and predictions than mammillary models, and may provide an intermediate step towards utilizing full PBPK models for mAbs.},

Employing these models to plan future development is proposed as a powerful solution to improve pharmaceutical R{\&}D productivity. The disease and trial models are, to a large extent, independent of the product, but the drug model is not. The goals are to apply the disease and trial models to future development and regulatory decisions, and publicly share them. We propose working definitions of these models, describe the various subcomponents, provide examples, and discuss the challenges and potential solutions for developing such models. Building useful disease-drug-trial models is a challenging task and cannot be achieved by any single organization. It requires a consorted effort by industry, academic, and regulatory scientists. We also describe the strategic goals of the FDA Pharmacometrics group.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The effect of ontogeny in drug-metabolizing enzymes on pediatric pharmacokinetics is poorly predicted. Voriconazole, a potent antifungal, is cleared predominantly via oxidative metabolism and exhibits vastly different pharmacokinetics between adults and children. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed integrating hepatic in vitro metabolism data with physiologic parameters to predict pharmacokinetic parameters of voriconazole in adult and pediatric populations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Adult and pediatric PBPK models integrated voriconazole physicochemical properties with hepatic in vitro data into the models. Simulated populations contained 100 patients (10 trials with 10 patients each). Trial design and dosing was based on published clinical trials. Simulations yielded pharmacokinetic parameters that were compared against published values and visual predictive checks were employed to validate models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All adult models and the pediatric intravenous model predicted pharmacokinetic parameters that corresponded with observed values within a 20 {\%} prediction error, whereas the pediatric oral model predicted an oral bioavailability twofold higher than observed ranges. After incorporating intestinal first-pass metabolism into the model, the prediction of oral bioavailability improved substantially, suggesting that voriconazole is subject to intestinal first-pass metabolism in children, but not in adults.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The PBPK approach used in this study suggests a mechanistic reason for differences in bioavailability between adults and children. If verified, this would be the first example of differential first-pass metabolism in children and adults.},

abstract = {Metformin, a widely implemented anti-diabetic drug, exhibits potent anticancer efficacies. Herein a polymeric construction of Metformin, PolyMetformin (PolyMet) is successfully synthesized through conjugation of linear polyethylenimine (PEI) with dicyandiamide. The delocalization of cationic charges in the biguanide groups of PolyMet reduces the toxicity of PEI both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the polycationic properties of PolyMet permits capture of siRNA into a core-membrane structured lipid-polycation-hyaluronic acid (LPH) nanoparticle for systemic gene delivery. Advances herein permit LPH-PolyMet nanoparticles to facilitate VEGF siRNA delivery for VEGF knockdown in a human lung cancer xenograft, leading to enhanced tumour suppressive efficacy. Even in the absence of RNAi, LPH-PolyMet nanoparticles act similarly to Metformin and induce antitumour efficacy through activation of the AMPK and inhibition of the mTOR. In essence, PolyMet successfully combines the intrinsic anticancer efficacy of Metformin with the capacity to carry siRNA to enhance the therapeutic activity of an anticancer gene therapy.},

abstract = {Conventional mammillary models are frequently used for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis when only blood or plasma data are available. Such models depend on the quality of the drug disposition data and have vague biological features. An alternative minimal-physiologically-based PK (minimal-PBPK) modeling approach is proposed which inherits and lumps major physiologic attributes from whole-body PBPK models. The body and model are represented as actual blood and tissue (usually total body weight) volumes, fractions (f ( d )) of cardiac output with Fick's Law of Perfusion, tissue/blood partitioning (K ( p )), and systemic or intrinsic clearance. Analyzing only blood or plasma concentrations versus time, the minimal-PBPK models parsimoniously generate physiologically-relevant PK parameters which are more easily interpreted than those from mammillary models. The minimal-PBPK models were applied to four types of therapeutic agents and conditions. The models well captured the human PK profiles of 22 selected beta-lactam antibiotics allowing comparison of fitted and calculated K ( p ) values. Adding a classical hepatic compartment with hepatic blood flow allowed joint fitting of oral and intravenous (IV) data for four hepatic elimination drugs (dihydrocodeine, verapamil, repaglinide, midazolam) providing separate estimates of hepatic intrinsic clearance, non-hepatic clearance, and pre-hepatic bioavailability. The basic model was integrated with allometric scaling principles to simultaneously describe moxifloxacin PK in five species with common K ( p ) and f ( d ) values. A basic model assigning clearance to the tissue compartment well characterized plasma concentrations of six monoclonal antibodies in human subjects, providing good concordance of predictions with expected tissue kinetics. The proposed minimal-PBPK modeling approach offers an alternative and more rational basis for assessing PK than compartmental models.},
