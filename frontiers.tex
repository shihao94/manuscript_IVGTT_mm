\section{MATERIALS AND METHODS}

\subsection{Clinical study data}
In this study, we used the dataset of 522 subjects pooled from 28 studies, including 241 healthy subjects, 118 obese subjects and 163 type 2 diabetes patients (T2DM). Obese subjects were classified as people in good general health with a body mass index (BMI) larger than 28 $kg/m^2$. Patients in the T2DM cohort had type 2 diabetes at the baseline or had a placebo administration. 238 of the subjects underwent an insulin-modified IVGTT and 284 had an IVGTT. Demographic characteristics were collected and summarized in Table. \ref{tab:demo}, which includes sex, age, weight, height and body mass index. For the subjects with missing continuous covariates, mean values reported in the original papers were used. For 51 subjects from two studies, the values of height, weight and BMI were missing, and only the ranges of BMI were reported. We used a virtual population generator (PopGen, \cite{McNally2015}) to generate virtual subjects for these two studies and applied the calculated mean weight to those subjects. Then, the heights were imputed using the equation: $H=\sqrt{weight/BMI}$ and the given mean BMI value. The sex information of 18 subjects from two studies was missing but the sex ratio (i.e., male/female) was mentioned in the literature, so random assignment was used to fill in the sex value. For 41 subjects, no sex information about gender was provided and their sex values were set as not available (NA).

\subsection{Minimal model}
We employed M1 version of the minimal model (\cite{Bergman1979}, \cite{Araujo-vilar1998}) to describe glucose-insulin disposition processes. The model equations can be showed as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dG(t)}{dt} =-(GEZI+X(t))*G(t)+(p_1+X_{basal})*G_{basal} \quad G_{(t=0)} =G_{basal}+Dose\label{eq:01}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{dX(t)}{dt} =-p2*X(t)+p2*S_I*I(t) \quad X_{basal} =S_I*I_{basal}\label{eq:02}
\end{equation}
where $Dose$ denotes the glucose dose at time zero, $G(t)$ is the plasma glucose amount (mmol), $G_{basal}$ is defined as basal glucose amount from the last measurement. $X(t)$ is the remote insulin action (min$^{-1}$) and $X_{basal}$ is its basal value. $I(t)$ is the plasma insulin concentration (pmol/L) and $I_{basal}$ is the last measured concentration defined as the baseline. $I(t)$ was set as known and error-free inputs of the model. Four model were estimated based on the measured glucose concentration: glucose effectiveness at zero insulin ($GEZI$, min$^{-1}$), insulin sensitivity ($S_I$, min$^{-1}$/(pmol/L)), remote insulin action parameter (min$^{-1}$) and the volume of glucose distribution (L). The glucose measurements prior to 5 min were excluded from the analysis, since the one-compartment model is not suitable for capturing the initial phase of glucose kinetics (\cite{Vicini1999}).

\subsection{Population modeling}
The minimal model (M1 version) was used as our base model and physiological covariates were evaluated to account for inter-individual variability (IIV) in model parameter estimates. We first analyzed the glucose concentration data of healthy, obese and T2DM cohorts separately, using the maximum-likelihood, expectation maximization (MLEM) program in ADAPT software (Version 5) (\cite{DArgenioDavidZ.SchumitzkyAlan2009}). The four model parameters were assumed to follow a multivariate log-normal distribution around a typical value, with a full covariance matrix. We used a proportional error model to describe the residual errors. Individual random effects of parameter estimates were obtained and plotted versus physiological covariates to explore their relations preliminarily. % In all the three cohorts, weight-related indexes (body weight, BMI) were found to negatively associate with SI (results not shown), which is consistent with the previous investigation %cite the book. Also, weight-related indexes (height, weight, BMI) are positively correlated with V (results not shown). This is also in line with a previous report (\cite{Denti2010}).
Next, we pooled the data from the three cohorts and the base model was fitted to the data. The development of covariate models was based on preliminary relations in different cohorts, previous reports (\cite{Denti2010}), % bergman book,
scientific interest and mechanistic plausibility. The covariates were selected based on good estimate precision and improved objection function value (-2 log likelihood) via forward addition and backward elimination (P$<$0.01). We tested potential covariate models for $S_I$ first, followed by $V$, $GEZI$ and $p2$. For continuous covariates (i.e., weight, height, BMI, age), power models centered at their median values were used. For discrete covariates (i.e., sex), a proportional change in the typical value and power term was investigated in the modeling process. The random effects of model parameters for the final model were checked against covariates to evaluate the remaining individual variation around the typical values.
