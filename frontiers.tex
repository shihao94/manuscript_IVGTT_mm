\section{}
Glucose effectiveness, defined as the ability of glucose itself to increase glucose utilization and inhibit hepatic glucose production, is an important mechanism that influences glucose homeostasis. Although glucose effectiveness has been quantified in several studies, there still exists some inconsistencies, probably due to the differences in experiments and limited subjects with different glucose tolerance conditions. In this study, we conducted a hierarchical modeling analysis using a composite minimal model to analyze insulin-glucose dynamics in 497 subjects with either normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n=343) or type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=154). The complete study data was used to inform the estimation of the population distribution of model parameters (e.g., glucose effectiveness at zero insulin, $GEZI$ and insulin sensitivity, $S_I$). Moreover, the hierarchical modeling analysis was used to identify subject specific factors that can explain the inter-individual variability in model parameters and quantify their effects. Glucose tolerance status was found to be affect $GEZI$, with T2D subjects showing 47.3 \% lower $GEZI$ compared to normal subjects. No other subject feature was identified to impact $GEZI$. On the other hand, $S_I$ estimate was found to associate with glucose tolerance status, body mass index and test type. The resulting model was also employed to calculate the proportion of net glucose uptake due to $GEZI$ in each subject after an intravenous glucose load. Based on individual parameter estimates, the fraction of glucose disposal due to $GEZI$ was 72.8\% $\pm$ 12.0\% in the 238 NGT subjects during the course of the experiment, indicating a major contribution of $GEZI$ to the whole-body glucose clearance under normal conditions. The fraction was significantly reduced to 48.8\% $\pm$ 16.9\% in the 30 T2D subjects, which still accounts for approximately half of the total in the T2D population according to our modeling analysis. Given the potential applications of glucose effectiveness as a predictor or therapeutic target of glucose intolerance and diabetes, more investigations of glucose effectiveness in other disease conditions and the influence of other explanatory covariates can be conducted using the hierarchical modeling framework reported herein.

\section{INTRODUCTION} % Succinct, with no subheadings
% 1. glucose intolerance, SG importance, modulation of SG and its impact, physiologic of SG, therapy based on SG
%Glucose intolerance, as determined by a combined interaction of insulin secretion, insulin action and glucose effectiveness ($S_G$), is a universal characteristic of both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Among the three components, glucose effectiveness is defined as the ability of glucose itself to increase glucose utilization and inhibit hepatic glucose production, via mass action effects and other mechanisms \citep{Dube2015}. Compared to insulin effects, glucose effectiveness exerts earlier influence to maintain normoglycemia. It was reported that, in normal subjects, glucose effectiveness independent of insulin accounts for 45\% to 65\% of the total glucose disposal after an intravenous glucose load \citep{Alford_2018}. In patients with defective insulin production and action (e.g., diabetes), the contribution of insulin is minimal and thus, $S_G$ mediated glucose disposition will dominate \citep{Dube2015}. The potential application of $S_G$ as the predictor and therapeutic target of glucose intolerance and T2D has been mentioned before (\citet{basu_2009}, \citet{pau_2014}, \citet{Alford_2018}). However, despite the equal or greater importance of glucose effectiveness, previous research has been mainly focused on impaired insulin secretion function and insulin resistance as important factors of glucose intolerance or diabetes, rather than glucose effectiveness \citep{Alford_2018}. Although limited investigations that quantify $S_G$ have reported decreased $S_G$ in T2D, there still exists some inconsistencies, probably due to the differences in experiments and limited subjects included in the analysis \citep{Dube2015}. 
Glucose homeostasis is determined by a combined interaction of many processes, among which insulin secretion, insulin action, insulin clearance and glucose effectiveness play a major role. Glucose effectiveness, defined as the ability of glucose itself to increase glucose utilization and inhibit hepatic glucose production via mass action effects and other mechanisms \citep{Dube2015}, exerts an earlier temporal influence relative to insulin in maintaining normoglycemia. In normal subjects, it has been reported that glucose effectiveness independent of insulin accounts for 45\% to 65\% of the total net glucose disposal following an intravenous glucose load \citep{Alford_2018}. In patients with defective insulin production and action, the contribution of insulin to glucose disposition is limited, and therefore the contribution of glucose effectiveness in limiting dysglycemia becomes more crucial \citep{Dube2015}. Given its central role in glucose homeostasis, glucose effectiveness impairment has been proposed as an important indicator of glucose intolerance and as a therapeutic target in the treatment of patients with impaired glucose regulation (\citet{basu_2009}, \citet{pau_2014}, \citet{Alford_2018}). However, there have been only limited studies aimed at quantifying glucose effectiveness in subjects with normal and impaired glucose tolerance, and there are inconsistencies in those studies that have been reported \citep{Dube2015}.

% 2. measurements, previous papers on SG and its role to glucose disposition, limitations
%Glucose clamp approach and minimal model (MM) approach have been commonly utilized to quantify glucose effectiveness. The glucose clamp approach involves controlling insulin at near-basal level so that the effects of glucose on its metabolism can be measured. Although this method is regarded as the gold standard of glucose kinetics evaluation, it requires cumbersome experiments and trained research teams. On the other hand, minimal model approach is a modeling analysis that is based on intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). MM method provides a simpler and reliable solution to obtain whole-body glucose disposition indices, including $S_G$ and insulin sensitivity ($S_I$) (\citet{bergman_equ}, \citet{jan_equ}). For example, \citet{jan_relative} analyzed the IVGTT data of 20 normoglycemic first degree relatives of T2D patients and another 20 matched subjects, and then calculated the relative contribution of insulin and glucose-mediated effects on glucose disposal. Their study suggested a major role of glucose effectiveness in both relatives and control subjects, but they only included a few subjects while ignoring the uncertainty of individual parameter estimates. Insulin-modified IVGTT (IM-IVGTT) has also been used to offer more insulin dynamics information than traditional IVGTT \citep{Vicini1999}. More recently, \citet{Denti2010} used a hierarchical modeling framework to analyze the IM-IVGTT data of 204 subjects. But their analysis only included healthy subjects and the relative contribution of glucose effectiveness versus insulin sensitivity was not investigated. Recently, a short IVGTT lasting only 1 hr has also been proposed to faster assess glucose effectiveness by the minimal model \citep{Morettini2018}. 
Glucose clamp experiments and the minimal model (MM) approach following an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) have been used to quantify glucose effectiveness \citep{Dube2015}. While the glucose clamp method, which involves controlling insulin at near-basal level, is regarded as the gold standard for accessing glucose disposition, it requires cumbersome experiments and trained research teams. In contrast, the MM analysis is based on a simpler IVGTT or insulin modified IVGTT (IM-IVGTT) \citep{IM_IV_1998}, and when coupled with a method for model-based statistical estimation, provides estimates of whole-body glucose disposition indices representing both glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity (\citet{bergman_equ}, \citet{jan_equ}). While many applications of the MM reported in the literature have largely focused on questions related to insulin sensitivity, the MM has also been used to better understand the role of glucose effectiveness in glucose homeostasis in healthy and disease conditions. For example, \citet{jan_relative} analyzed IVGTT data of 20 normoglycemic first degree relatives of T2D patients and another 20 matched subjects, where they observed an increased glucose effectiveness in the relatives. The study by \cite{lorenzo_2010} assessed whether glucose effectiveness estimated via MM analysis in healthy participants could predict the future occurrence of T2D. More recently, \citet{Morettini_2019} analysed results from a collection of previous studies in subjects with normal glucose tolerance, focusing on factors associated with differences in glucose effectiveness including body mass index. To explore pathogenic factors in type 2 diabetes, \citet{ataru_1992} analyzed IM-IVGTT data from 11 healthy subjects and 9 T2D patients, and concluded that diminished glucose effectiveness is partially responsible for glucose intolerance. Similarly, \citet{welch_1990} observed a decrease in glucose effectiveness in diabetic subjects based on MM analysis of 21 subjects. These studies using the MM to assess glucose effectiveness have involved either only non-diabetic subjects (e.g., \citet{jan_relative}, \cite{lorenzo_2010}, \citet{Morettini_2019}), or included only a small number of subjects with T2D (e.g., \citet{ataru_1992} and \citet{welch_1990}). Moreover, none of these studies has aimed at developing a single composite minimal model representing both NGT and T2D subjects.

%  3. our study: pooled studies, large population; composite analysis; pop modeling, covariates; NGT and T2D; relative contribution
To address these limitations, we conducted a MM analysis of glucose effectiveness using data obtained from previously conducted studies that included subjects with normal glucose tolerance (n=343) and those with type 2 diabetes (n=154). A hierarchical statistical analysis was performed using the MM, which provides a formal mechanism for pooling the data from all study subjects, yielding an composite model for the population that quantifies the role of subject specific characteristics such as weight, height, age, sex, glucose tolerance on glucose effectiveness.

\section{MATERIALS AND METHODS}
\vskip 0.5cm
\subsection{Clinical study data}
% In this study, we pooled the glucose-insulin concentration-time data of 497 subjects from 51 groups, with a total of 8024 measurements . In Table. \ref{tab:studies}, we summarized the pooled studies by each study group, with the cohorts, sex information, mean demographic characteristics, study types and references displayed. The whole dataset includes 228 healthy subjects, 115 obese subjects and 154 type 2 diabetes patients (T2D). Obese subjects were classified as people in good general health with a body mass index (BMI) larger than 28 $kg/m^2$. Patients in the T2D cohort had type 2 diabetes at the baseline or had a placebo administration. 229 of the subjects underwent an insulin-modified IVGTT and 268 had an IVGTT. For the subjects with missing continuous covariates, mean values reported in the original papers were used if available (Table. \ref{tab:studies}). For 40 subjects from study groups 31, 32, 33, 34, the values of height, weight and BMI were missing, and only the ranges of BMI were reported. We used a virtual population generator (PopGen, \citet{McNally2015}) to generate virtual subjects for these four groups and applied the calculated mean weight to those subjects. Then, the heights were imputed using the equation: $H=\sqrt{weight/BMI}$ and the given mean BMI value. The sex information of 18 subjects from two study groups 6 and 36 was missing but the sex ratio (i.e., male/female) was mentioned in the literature, so random assignment was used to fill in the sex value. For 41 subjects from groups 9, 10, 28, 29, 40, no sex information about gender was provided and their sex values were set as not available (NA). 
This study involves a pooled analysis of data from previous studies, each performed following the Declaration of Helsinki and upon approval of the respective institutional ethics committees, in which subjects were administered either a regular intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) or an insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (IM-IVGTT). A total of 44 study groups was included in the analysis, comprising 497 different subjects as summarized in Table \ref{tab:studies}, that also summarizes sex, age and other anthropometric characteristics. Subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (according to the guidelines in \citet{Diabetes_Care}) were incorporated in the analysis, including both obese (body mass index (BMI) $>$ 28 $kg/m^2$) and non-obese subjects, but not subjects with other conditions that might alter glucose regulation. A standard IVGTT was performed in 268 subjects, while an IM-IVGTT was administered to 229 subjects. 

%\vskip 0.01cm
Studies in which some of the characteristics are missing in individual subjects are noted in Table \ref{tab:studies}, with missing values imputed as follows. For studies in which only mean values of age, weight, height or BMI were reported (see table), each subject was assigned the corresponding mean value from that study. In 40 subjects from four of the study groups, the values of height, weight and BMI were missing, and only the mean BMI and its standard deviation (SD) were reported. For these subjects, we applied the virtual population anthropomorphic generator PopGen (\cite{McNally2015}) to produce 40 virtual subjects, using the reported mean BMI$\pm$2SD as the required BMI range, the reported mean age, and the reported proportion of males \citep{1998_AGING_Ahren}. The resulting mean body weight of the virtual subjects in each group was then assigned to each of the 40 subjects, with the missing heights calculated as $H=\sqrt{weight/BMI}$ using the mean BMI value. The sex of 18 subjects from two study groups (see Table \ref{tab:studies}) was missing but the proportion of men and woman was reported, and the latter was used to randomly assign the sex of the subjects. For 41 subjects from five studies, no sex was provided, and the sex of these subjects was classified as not available (NA). After missing covariate imputation, characteristics of all 497 subjects are as summarized in Table \ref{tab:demo}, which includes sex, age, weight, height and body mass index. A graphic overview of investigated covariates is provided in Figure \ref{fig: cova}.

\subsection{Minimal model}
% We employed M1 version of the minimal model (\citet{Bergman1979}, \citet{Araujo-vilar1998}) to describe glucose-insulin disposition processes. The model equations can be showed as:
The following parameterization of the minimal model for glucose and insulin was used in the analysis (\citet{Bergman1979}, \citet{Araujo-vilar1998}):
\begin{equation}
\frac{dG(t)}{dt} =-(GEZI+X(t))*G(t)+(GEZI+X_{basal})*G_{basal}, \quad G(0) =G_{basal}+\frac{Dose}{V}\label{eq:01}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{dX(t)}{dt} =-p2*X(t)+p2*S_I*I(t), \quad X(0) =S_I*I_{basal}\label{eq:02}
\end{equation}
where $Dose$ denotes the glucose dose (mmol) at time zero, $G(t)$ is the plasma glucose concentration (mmol/L), $G_{basal}$ is basal glucose concentration (measured glucose at the end point), $X(t)$ is the remote insulin action (min$^{-1}$), $I(t)$ is the measured plasma insulin concentration (pmol/L) and $I_{basal}$ is the basal insulin concentration (measured insulin at the end point). $I(t)$ was defined by linearly interpolating the measured insulin concentrations. Model parameters are: glucose effectiveness at zero insulin ($GEZI$, min$^{-1}$), insulin sensitivity ($S_I$, min$^{-1}$/(pmol/L)), remote insulin action parameter ($p2$, min$^{-1}$) and the volume of glucose distribution ($V$, L). For IVGTT, a glucose dose of 0.3 g/kg was administrated to the subjects at time zero. The study duration ranged between 180 min and 360 min, while the number of samples ranged from 12 to 30 for each subject. For IM-IVGTT, the same glucose dose was given and a short insulin infusion of between 0.03 to 0.05 U/kg was administered at 20 min. The duration of the IM-IVGTT studies ranged between 180 min and 240 min and number of samples ranged from 12 to 22. The glucose measurements obtained prior to 5 min were excluded from the analysis, since the one-compartment glucose kinetic model does not represent the initial phase of glucose disposition \citep{Vicini1999}.

\subsection{Hierarchical modeling analysis}
% The minimal model (M1 version) was used as our base model and physiological covariates were evaluated to account for inter-individual variability (IIV) in model parameter estimates. We first analyzed the glucose concentration data of healthy, obese and T2D cohorts separately, using the maximum-likelihood, expectation maximization (MLEM) program in ADAPT software (Version 5) \citep{AdaptUserGuide}. The four model parameters were assumed to follow a multivariate log-normal distribution around a typical value, with a full covariance matrix. We used a proportional error model to describe the residual errors. Individual random effects of parameter estimates were obtained and plotted versus physiological covariates to explore their relations preliminarily. 
% Next, we combined the data from the three cohorts and the base model was fitted to the data. The development of covariate models was based on preliminary relations in different cohorts, previous reports, scientific interest and mechanistic plausibility. The covariates were selected based on good estimate precision and improved objection function value (-2 log likelihood) via forward addition and backward elimination (p$<$0.01). We tested potential covariate models for $S_I$ first, followed by $V$, $GEZI$ and $p2$. For continuous covariates (i.e., weight, height, BMI, age), power models centered at their median values were used. For discrete covariates (i.e., sex), proportional changes in the typical value and power term were investigated in the modeling process. The random effects of model parameters for the final model were checked against covariates to evaluate the remaining individual variation around the typical values.
Hierarchical or population modeling, which is used widely in drug development, provides a formal basis for determining the distribution of model parameters in a population (central tendency and dispersion) and identifying relevant covariates that may explain aspects of the population parameter distribution (see \citet{Bonate2011}). Notable applications of population modeling to the glucose-insulin system include the work of \citet{agbaje_2003} using a Bayesian analysis and that of \citet{Denti2010} using approximated maximum likelihood methods.

In this work, Eqs (\ref{eq:01}) and (\ref{eq:02}) define the first stage of the hierarchical framework, where the residual error (defined as the difference between the measured and predicted glucose concentrations) was assumed to be normally distributed with variance proportional to the predicted glucose concentration. For the second stage of the hierarchy, the vector of model parameters, $\log \theta  \equiv \log \left[ {GEZI\,\,{S_I}\,\,p2\,\,V} \right]$, is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution, $\log \theta  \sim N\left( {{\mu_{\log \theta }},\,{\Sigma _{\log \theta }}} \right)$, with the population mean   ${\mu _{\log \theta }}$, covariance $\,{\Sigma _{\log \theta }}$, and the conditional mean for each each subject $E\left[ {\log {\theta _i}} \right],\,i = 1, \ldots ,n$, are estimated from the pooled study data. The maximum likelihood estimates of   ${\mu _{\log \theta }}$, $\,{\Sigma _{\log \theta }}$ and $E\left[ {\log {\theta _i}} \right]$ were obtain using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm as applied to solve the nonlinear mixed effects hierarchical modeling problem by \citet{Schumitzky1995EMAnalysis} and  by \citet{walker_1996}, and as implemented in  MLEM application in ADAPT (Version 5) software \citep{AdaptUserGuide}. 

The following covariates were examined for their influence on  model parameters: age, body weight, height, BMI, sex, and glucose tolerance (NGT/T2D). We also included  test type (IVGTT/IM-IVGTT) as a covariate since some previous studies indicated that here may be a difference in MM parameter estimates between IVGTT and IM-IVGTT experiments \citep{IM_IV_1998}. Initially covariate-parameter relationships were identified based on exploratory graphical analysis and mechanistic plausibility. The final explanatory covariates were selected based on estimate precision and objective function value (-2 log likelihood) improvement, as determined via forward addition analysis of covariates \citep{Bonate2011}. We tested covariate models for $S_I$ initially, followed by $V$, $GEZI$ and $p2$. For continuous covariates (age, body weight, height, BMI), power models centered at their median values of the covariates were used. For categorical covariates (sex, glucose tolerance and test type), changes in the covariate model parameters between categories were investigated.

% covariate relationships (fig. 1), table of prm estimates, diagnostic plots (fittings, comparison, residual error), model equation
% Using the data of each of the three cohorts, weight-related indexes (body weight, BMI) were found to negatively associate with $S_I$ (results not shown), which is consistent with the previous investigation \citep{Bergman1997TheTolerance}. Also, weight-related indexes (height, weight, BMI) are positively correlated with V (results not shown). This is also in line with a previous report \citep{Denti2010}. After pooling all the data together, the following minimal model with covariates was selected to describe the insulin-glucose profiles: $GEZI=0.0211*(1-0.480*T2D)$; for NGT subjects, $T2D$ is 0; for T2D subjects, $T2D$ is 1; $S_I=(5.59e-05)*(1-0.575*T2D)*(BMI/25.335)^{-2.12}$; BMI is in $kg/m^2$; $p2=0.0428$; 
Table \ref{tab:prm estimates} (second column) presents the results of the population modeling analysis using the minimal model in Eqs. \ref{eq:01} and \ref{eq:02} without incorporating covariates in the stage 2 parameter distribution model. The table shows the typical values (TV) of the model parameters as a measure of the central tendency of the parameter population distribution ($TV = {e^{{\mu _{\log \theta }}}}$), as well as the parameter inter-individual variability (IIV) as a measure of dispersion of the population distribution ($IIV \equiv \left\{ {100\sqrt {{{\left( {{\Sigma _{\log \theta }}} \right)}_{ii}}} } \right\},\,i = 1, \ldots ,4$). In the third column of Table \ref{tab:prm estimates}, the corresponding results are presented from the population analysis that included the identified explanatory covariates, as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS.

All model parameters were well estimated, with relative standard error less than 20 CV\%, and the model with covariates (final model) yielded a significant reduction in the log likelihood compared to the base model without covariates (log ratio test, $p<10^{-6}$). The upper row of the goodness-of-fit plots in Figure \ref{fig: fittings} shows the population prediction of the base model (Figure \ref{fig: fittings}(A)) and that of the final covariate model (Figure \ref{fig: fittings}(B)), indicating an improved description of the observed data with the later. Plots of the resulting conditional standardized residuals from the final model versus the population predicted glucose concentration (Figure \ref{fig: fittings}(C)) and versus time (Figure \ref{fig: fittings}(D)), indicate that the final population model describes the observed glucose concentrations without significant bias.

\subsection{$GEZI$ is decreased in T2D but is not associated with other covariates}
In the final population model, the typical value of $GEZI$ depends on glucose tolerance category as follows: $GEZI=0.0210*(1-0.473*T2D)$ (min$^{-1}$), where $T2D=1$ for T2D subjects and $T2D=0$ for NGT subjects. The distribution of $GEZI$ in the NGT population was estimated to have a typical value of 0.021 min$^{-1}$  with inter-individual variability of $\pm$ 0.0097 min$^{-1}$. The corresponding values in the T2D population were estimated to be 0.012 $\pm$ 0.0055 min$^{-1}$. This 47\% reduction in the value of $GEZI$ in T2D subjects relative to NGT subjects was found to be highly significant ($p<10^{-6}$) via a likelihood ratio test. The distribution of individual subject conditional mean estimates of $GEZI$ in NGT and T2D subjects is shown in Figure \ref{fig: SG_co}. We also explored possible covariate models relating $GEZI$ to $BMI$ in both NGT and T2D subjects, but no associations were found to be significant. Moreover, the variability in $GEZI$ could not be further explained by subjects’ age, weight, height or sex; while a decreasing association between $GEZI$ and age was noted, this was not statistically significant. No differences in $GEZI$ were found between subjects that underwent an IVGTT versus an IM-IVGTT experiment.

\vskip 0.5cm
\subsection{$S_I$ decreases with BMI in both NGT and T2D}
In the final population model, $S_I$ was found to be associated with BMI, a priori glucose tolerance status, and test type by the following model: $S_I=(6.26e-05)*(1-0.479*T2D)*(1-0.345*IM)*(BMI/25.3)^{-2.14}$, where $IM=1$ for IM-IVGTT and $IM=0$ for IVGTT. Figure \ref{fig: SI_BMI} shows the estimated relationships between the typical value of $S_I$ and $BMI$ for both NGT and T2D subjects from each of the two test types. In both NGT and T2D groups, higher BMI values lead to decreased $S_I$ (with a power of -2.14). This is consistent with the conclusions in \citet{Bergman1997TheTolerance}, in which they reported a negative association between BMI and $S_I$. For a given BMI, the population model shows a significant decrease (approximately 48\%) in $S_I$, between the T2D subjects versus those with NGT. Our results indicated that IM-IVGTT is associated with significanly lower $S_I$ (approximately 35\%) estimate when compared to IVGTT ($p<10^{-5}$). The addition of weight, height or sex to the population model was not found to be significant.\\

\subsection{$GEZI's$ significant contribution to net glucose disposal is  greater in NGT than T2D following a glucose load}
% In order to compare the relative contribution of $GEZI$ and $S_I$ on controlling glucose concentration, we simulated the glucose profiles of four virtual subjects with different $GEZI$ and $S_I$ values during an IVGTT (Figure \ref{fig: simu}). We fixed the body weight and BMI to the median value of all subjects, so that the virtual subjects had the same $p2$ and volume of distribution ($V$) without any effects by BMI or body weight. Compared to the healthy subject A, $GEZI$ and $S_I$ were reduced due to the development of T2D in other virtual subjects. The most impaired function of controlling glucose can be observed in the virtual subject B (a typical T2D patient) (Figure \ref{fig: simu}). The comparison of glucose profiles of subject C and D indicates the decrease of $GEZI$ due to T2D results in stronger influence than the corresponding reduction in $S_I$, which suggests the important role of glucose effectiveness in the regulation of glucose homeostasis \citep{Dube2015}. 
In order to compare the relative contributions of $GEZI$ and $S_I$ to net glucose disposal, we determined the proportion of glucose uptake due to glucose itself and that due to insulin, in subjects with NGT and those with T2D, in both the basal state and during an IVGTT experiment. Under basal conditions, the fraction of glucose disposal mediated by $GEZI$ can be calculated using the individual conditional mean estimates of $GEZI$ and $S_I$, together with the measured $I_{basal}$ of each subject $\left( {GEZI/\left( {GEZI + {S_I}{I_{basal}}} \right)} \right)$. In the 343 NGT subjects, $GEZI$ accounted for 88.5\% $\pm$ 7.10\% of the total net glucose disposal, and 89.0\% $\pm$ 10.2\% in the 154 T2D subjects. In the IVGTT experiment group (268 subjects) we calculated the net glucose disposal mediated by $GEZI$ and that due to $S_I$ during the course of the experiment, based on individual subject estimates. In the 238 NGT subjects in this group, the fraction of glucose disposal due to $GEZI$ was 72.8\% $\pm$ 12.0\%, while it was 48.8\% $\pm$ 16.9\% in the 30 T2D subjects in the IVGTT group (Figure \ref{fig: frac}), and this difference was significant ($p<10^{-6}$, unpaired two-samples Wilcoxon test). Our model based analysis indicates that $GEZI$ accounts for the large majority of the glucose disposal in the NGT population and approximately half of the total in the T2D population.  
\section{DISCUSSION}

% 1. discussion of modeling results; mention remaining random effects of SG, SI, p2, V
%In this work, we applied a hierarchical modeling analysis of 497 subjects with NGT or T2D in IVGTT and IM-IVGTT studies. The minimal model with $GEZI$ as a parameter was employed to describe insulin-glucose dynamics. Subject  characteristics, glucose tolerance status and test type were considered to explain the IIV in model parameter estimates. The resulting model includes cohort effects on $GEZI$, cohort, BMI and test type effects on $S_I$ and body weight effects on $V$ ($V=12.0*(weight/75)^{0.865}$; weight is in kg). The incorporation of covariates into the model reduces the IIV of $GEZI$, $S_I$ and $V$ from 50.9\%,  113\% and 34.4\% to 46.1\%, 83.8\% and 26.8\%, respectively (Table \ref{tab:prm estimates}). Although height displayed a slightly correlated with $S_I$ and $V$ in our final model, it was not integrated into the model without any physiological evidence.  
In this work, a hierarchical modeling analysis was conducted to develop a composite population minimal model of glucose-insulin dynamics in NGT and T2D subjects, using data from IVGTT and IM-IVGTT studies. The resulting population model was used to quantify the role of subject characteristics (age, body weight, height, BMI, sex, glucose tolerance status) and test type (IVGTT/IM-IVGTT) on glucose effectiveness and other MM parameters. In the final composite population model, glucose tolerance status (NGT, T2D) was a significant predictor of glucose effectiveness, as assessed by $GEZI$. The addition of other covariates did not further explain remaining inter-subject variability in $GEZI$, beyond that predicted by glucose tolerance status. Further analysis of the population model indicated that the relative contribution to the total net glucose disposal attributable to GEZI was significantly greater in NGT compared to T2D subjects. Also, a significant relation between insulin sensitivity, $S_I$, and BMI was identified in both NGT and T2D populations, albeit different in the two groups. Moreover, the estimated $S_I$-BMI relations were found to depend on test type, with a lower population value of $S_I$ observed in IM-IVGTT versus IVGTT studies, after accounting for BMI. 

% 2. SG, T2D, covariate, relative contribution; physiology, clinical significance, our advance of the views; 
% done: check Alford_2018 paper; previous studies of SG in normal and T2D, dube 2015, Theodorakis2017; any covariate on SG mentioned in NGT and T2D
% maybe: also compare other results from glucose clamp approach;
% As insulin requires more time to reach the target tissues to exert influence, the net glucose disposal mediated by glucose-effectiveness is more important early after a glucose load \citep{Best1996}. $GEZI$ estimated from the minimal model is a hybrid parameter encompassing the effects of glucose effectiveness on both glucose disposal and endogenous production \citep{Vicini1999}. The deterioration of glucose effectiveness in T2D compared to NGT found in this study is consistent with the previous conclusion in \citet{welch_1990} and \citet{ataru_1992}, but we provide a more reliable quantitative description of $GEZI$ change in T2D by analyzing a large number of subjects within a hierarchical modeling framework. Using the final model with covariates integrated, age and height still showed a slight negative association with $GEZI$ individual estimates, but neither of them was found to be a significant predictor based on the MLEM analysis. Same as \citet{Denti2010} and \citet{hoffman_2000}, no physiological covariate except cohort in our study was found to predict $GEZI$ in NGT and T2D subjects. This result extends the conclusion in \citet{pacini_1998}, in which they found no direct influence of age on glucose effectiveness by analyzing 17 elderly healthy subjects. Although a weak correlation between log transformed $GEZI$ and BMI was found in \citet{Morettini_2019} ($p=0.03$) based on the MM analysis of 204 healthy subjects, no such relationship was observed in our study ($p=0.31$). This discrepancy may be caused by the difference in subjects' data or the analysis approach (population method versus non-population method). As mentioned in \citet{Morettini_2019}, BMI does not differentiate between extra fat and lean body mass. As a result, it can not provide the information of abdominal fat distribution, which is an important predictor of cardiometabolic diseases \citep{Klein_2007}. Thus, the influence of other clinical features (e.g., waist circumference) that measures central fat accumulation on $GEZI$ can be explored in future work. \citet{Best1996} proposed that, at the basal insulin level, glucose effectiveness can account for 60\% to 75\% of the glucose uptake, depending on the basal glucose concentration. In our study, the corresponding glucose disposal fraction mediated by $GEZI$ was calculated (see Results section) to be around 89\%, which confirms the central role of glucose effectiveness in glucose regulation. Besides, the relative contribution of $GEZI$ during an IVGTT was obtained via model simulation. The average value of 72.8\% in NGT subjects is basically aligned with the report range of 45\% to 65\% in \citet{Alford_2018}. The average of 48.8\% in 30 T2D patients indicates the glucose disposal via $GEZI$ is diminished by T2D more than $S_I$. However, glucose effectiveness still accounts for approximately half of total disposition in that population. Although \citet{Best1996} claimed glucose effectiveness had a dominant contribution (83\%) in insulin-resistant subjects based on a oral glucose tolerance study, our results (Figure \ref{fig: frac}) indicates the fraction of glucose effectiveness in T2D during an IVGTT ranges from 19.7\% to 88.6\%, depending on the specific influence of diabetes on $GEZI$ and $S_I$.  
Based on the composite population model (Table \ref{tab:prm estimates}), glucose effectiveness, as assessed by $GEZI$ in this study, is reduced from 0.021 min$^{-1}$ (RSE – 0.00078 min$^{-1}$) in the NGT population to 0.012 min$^{-1}$ (RSE – 0.00045 min$^{-1}$) in T2D. Moreover, there is less inter-individual variability in GEZI in the T2D population (0.0051 min$^{-1}$, RSE – 0.00026 min$^{-1}$) relative to NGT (0.0097 min$^{-1}$, RSE – 0.00049 min$^{-1}$). This result is qualitatively consistent with other studies that reported a reduction in glucose effectiveness, as assessed by $S_G$, involving smaller numbers of T2D subjects (\citet{welch_1990} and \citet{ataru_1992}. We also examined potential associations between $GEZI$ and both BMI and age, and while a negative relation was noted with each, neither age nor BMI was found to be significant, when considering all subjects, or separately within the NGT and T2D populations. The lack of association with age is consistent with the conclusion in \citet{pacini_1998} from their analysis of $S_G$ in 17 elderly healthy subjects. \citet{Morettini_2019} did, however, find a weak but statistically significant relation between $GEZI$ and BMI based on a MM analysis of 204 healthy subjects. While we also noted a negative correlation between $GEZI$ and BMI, this was not found to be statistically significant in our study.

Further analysis of the population model indicated that the relative contribution to total net glucose disposal attributable to GEZI in IVGTT experiments was significantly greater in NGT compared to T2D subjects (Figure \ref{fig: frac}). Although \cite{Kahn_1994} previously concluded the major influence of $GEZI$ on glucose disappearance constant in healthy subjects via linear regression, our model based analysis provides a more reliable quantitative description of the relative contribution of $GEZI$ in each subject. The average fraction of 72.8\% ($\pm$ 12.0\%) found in NGT is somewhat higher than the report range of 45\% to 65\% in \citet{Alford_2018}, but consistent with the reported value of 71\% ($\pm$ 4\%) in IVGTT in mice \citep{PACINI_2001}. While $GEZI$-mediated glucose disposal is significantly reduced in the T2D subjects, and diminished to a greater extent than that mediated by $S_I$, glucose effectiveness still accounts for approximately 50\% of the net glucose uptake in the T2D based on our population analysis. While \citet{Best1996} reported that the contribution of glucose effectiveness to glucose disposal is dominant in insulin-resistant subjects (83\%) based on an oral glucose tolerance study, our results (Figure \ref{fig: frac}) indicate that the contribution of glucose effectiveness in T2D subjects in IVGTT can range widely (19.7\% to 88.6\%). Under basal conditions in both NGT and T2D subjects, the population modeling analysis found that the fraction of net glucose disposal mediated by $GEZI$ was approximately 89\% (see Results section). For comparison, \citet{Best1996} reported that at basal insulin levels, glucose effectiveness can account for 60\% to 75\% of the glucose uptake based on the clamp approach, depending on the basal glucose concentration.

% Hierarchical modeling has been more recently employed for the glucose-insulin system and demonstrates improved estimation performance than non-population methods, as it can account for the uncertainty in individual estimates and utilize the information from reduced sampling (\citet{agbaje_2003}, \citet{Denti2009}, \citet{Denti2010}). For example, \citet{agbaje_2003} adopted hierarchial modeling to analyze IM-IVGTT data of 65 T2D subjects and concluded hierarchial modeling provided more reliable results than the traditional non-linear regression, especially for lower $S_I$. Since they focused on comparing different analysis approaches, only the base MM was adopted. More recently, \citet{Denti2010} selected significant physiological features (covariates) to explain part of the IIV in estimated minimal model parameters from the data of 204 healthy subjects after IM-IVGTT. The selected covariates were integrated them into the final model to enhance the model predictive power. In their final model, $S_I$ was proposed to correlate with age, visceral abdominal fat and basal insulinemia. However, another study by \citet{helen_2010_age} concluded the reduced $S_I$ in elderly subjects is in fact caused by obesity rather than age directly. Indeed, our analysis also confirm the effects of extra adipose (BMI) to regulate $S_I$, rather than age. On the other hand, the use of basal insulinemia as an independent covariate should be taken with caution, as it can be affected by other covariates, which may obscure the relationship. \citet{Morettini_2019} showed a negative association between log-transformed basal insulin effect (BIE, BIE$=S_I*I_b$) and BMI. Our analysis confirmed this relation ($p<10^{-5}$), which was probably caused by the negative correlation between $S_I$ and BMI. The role of $S_I$ as the predictor and determinant of type 2 diabetes and relevant diseases have been well studied \citep{Bergman1997TheTolerance}. A significant decrease (47.9\%) of $S_I$ in subjects with established T2D was supported in this study. Thus, in subjects with type 2 diabetes, the deterioration of $GEZI$ and $S_I$ will synergistically lead to glucose intolerance. 
The population modeling results predicting a significant lower $S_I$ in the T2D population compared to the NGT population (approximately 47.9\%, RSE=10\%) were expected, given the well-documented ability of $S_I$ to predict glucose tolerance \citep{Bergman1997TheTolerance}. The negative association between $S_I$ and BMI quantified in the population model (see Figure \ref{fig: SI_BMI}) is also consistent with other studies in NGT and T2D populations (\citet{welch_1990}, \citet{Morettini_2019}). From the analysis, it was also concluded that there is a significant difference in the $S_I$ values between subjects administered an IVGTT versus an IM-IVGTT (? Giovanni and Andrea, Has this been observed previously? Is it worth noting here?). However, these results related to BMI should be interpreted cautiously, given the well-known challenges associated with using BMI as independent factor to explain differences in $S_I$, without incorporating information related to fat distribution \citep{Klein_2007}. The typical glucose distribution volume $V$ was found to depend on body weight following a nonlinear relationship: $V (L)=12.0*(weight/75)^{0.865}$ (weight in kg). The typical glucose distribution volume of 12 L is basically consistent with the reported range of 1.65-1.70 dl/kg in \citet{Denti2010}. Finally, while no relation between $p2$ and any covariates was found to be significant, $p2$ was determined to be positively correlated with $GEZI$ ($r$=0.77) (the ability to estimate all parameter correlations in the population is intrinsic to hierarchical modeling analysis). Thus, any association between $p2$ and glucose tolerance could be reflected in its correlation with $GEZI$.

In this study, a hierarchical modeling analysis was used to develop a composite population minimal model in a diverse collection of subjects who were assessed to have either normal glucose tolerance or to have type 2 diabetes. This modeling analysis allows the complete study data to be integrated and used to simultaneously inform the estimation of the population distribution of model parameters (mean and covariance), which provides a mechanism for identifying explanatory subject specific factors (anthropomorphic, pathophysiological, treatment, study, etc.) and quantifying their effects on model parameters. Hierarchical modeling has been applied previously in MM studies, including by \citet{agbaje_2003} who used a Bayesian framework to analyze results from IM-IVGTT experiments in 65 T2D subjects, and more recently by \citet{Denti2010} using approximate maximum likelihood methods in a study of 204 healthy subjects after IM-IVGTT. An advantage of using hierarchical modeling as implemented in this study, is that it allows for a multivariate assessment of the relative contribution of subject specific characteristics. A limitation of the approach, beyond the additional computational difficulties associated with implementing the EM algorithm to obtain the analytically exact maximum likelihood estimates, is that the MM parameters are assumed to follow a defined distribution in the population (specifically, $\log \left[ GEZI\,\,{S_I}\,\,p2\,\,V] \sim N\left( {\mu_{\log \theta }},\,{\Sigma_{\log \theta}} \right)$). Also, as with any multivariate analysis, identifying the explanatory covariates depends on the specific statistical procedure and the associated criteria for including and excluding covariates, which can be particularly challenging when covariates are not independent.

%The role of glucose effectiveness as an important predictor of glucose intolerance and diabetes has been suggested in several studies (\citet{Martin1992}, \citet{lorenzo_2010}), in which they found a defect in glucose effectiveness precedes diabetes development even when subjects are normoglycaemic. Also, glucose effectiveness can be a potential target of glucose-reducing therapy \citep{Ahren_2020}. Although the molecular mechanisms of glucose effectiveness regulating glucose remains to be elucidated, studies have demonstrated pharmacological intervention \citep{pau_2014} and exercise \citep{kar_2017} can improve glucose effectiveness to help increase whole-body glucose clearance. Recently, the development of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors has provided a novel antidiabetic therapy independent of insulin action \citep{SGLT2_2015}. In our study, the value of glucose effectiveness at zero insulin ($GEZI$) was not altered by age, weight or BMI, which can guide the development of future therapeutics based on glucose effectiveness for different populations.
The role of glucose effectiveness as a predictor of glucose intolerance and diabetes has been suggested in several studies (\citet{Martin1992}, \citet{lorenzo_2010}), which have reported that reduced glucose effectiveness may precede diabetes development even in normoglycaemic subjects. Indeed, the modeling analysis in this study suggests $GEZI$ may be a predictor of the deranged glucose tolerance status. Also, glucose effectiveness may be a possible target for glucose-reducing therapies \citep{Ahren_2020}. Although the molecular mechanisms of glucose effectiveness in regulating glucose remains to be more fully elucidated, some studies have demonstrated that pharmacological intervention \citep{pau_2014} and exercise \citep{kar_2017} can improve glucose effectiveness and increase plasma glucose clearance. Recently, the development of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors has provided a novel antidiabetic therapy independent of insulin action \citep{SGLT2_2015}. % Based on our analysis, glucose effectiveness at zero insulin ($GEZI$) was not significantly related to subjects age, weight, sex or BMI. 

%In summary, we have conducted a hierarchical minimal model analysis of glucose-insulin data from 497 NGT or T2D subjects after an intravenous glucose load, which allow us to quantify the influence of diabetes, body weight and BMI on the glucose metabolic parameters, while accounting for the differences in study types. The relative contribution of $GEZI$ in NGT and T2D populations was calculated using this modeling tool and emphasized the crucial function of glucose effectiveness in net glucose disposal. Although this work was focused on MM analysis of NGT and T2D subjects, this hierarchical modeling framework can be applied to investigate glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity in other disease conditions while considering other significant covariatesin future studies. Given the potential applications of glucose effectiveness in the diagnostic or treatment of diabetes, more studies are warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms and effective regulation of glucose effectiveness.  
In summary, we have conducted a hierarchical minimal model analysis of the glucose-insulin response in NGT and T2D subjects given an intravenous glucose load, which allowed us to quantify the influence of diabetes status, BMI and body weight on the glucose metabolic parameters, while accounting for the differences in the study type. The relative contribution of $GEZI$ to the total net glucose disposal in NGT and T2D populations was determined using the resulting population model, demonstrating the utility of this modeling approach to quantify the fraction of glucose disposition attributable to $GEZI$ based on an IVGTT. Although this work was focused on MM analysis of NGT and T2D subjects, the hierarchical modeling framework can be applied to investigate glucose effectiveness in other disease conditions, and to investigate other possible explanatory covariates in future studies.
